AMATORY COLLOQUY BETWEEN BANK AND GOVERNMENT.

1826.


BANK.

Is all then forgotten? those amorous pranks
  You and I in our youth, my dear Government, played;
When you called me the fondest, the truest of Banks,
  And enjoyed the endearing _advances_ I made!

When left to ourselves, unmolested and free,
  To do all that a dashing young couple should do,
A law against _paying_ was laid upon me,
  But none against _owing_, dear helpmate, on you.

And is it then vanisht?--that "hour (as Othello
  So happily calls it) of Love and _Direction_?"
And must we, like other fond doves, my dear fellow,
  Grow good in our old age and cut the connection?

GOVERNMENT.

Even so, my beloved Mrs. Bank, it must be;
  This paying in cash plays the devil with wooing:
We've both had our swing, but I plainly foresee
  There must soon be a stop to our _bill_ing and cooing.

Propagation in reason--a small child or two--
  Even Reverend Malthus himself is a friend to;
The issue of some folks is moderate and few--
  But _ours_, my dear corporate Bank, there's no end to!

So--hard tho' it be on a pair, who've already
  Disposed of so many pounds, shillings and pence;
And in spite of that pink of prosperity, Freddy,[1]
  So lavish of cash and so sparing of sense--

The day is at hand, my Papyria[2] Venus,
  When--high as we once used to carry our capers--
Those soft _billet-doux_ we're now passing between us,
  Will serve but to keep Mrs. Coutts in curl-papers:

And when--if we _still_ must continue our love,
  (After all that has past)--our amour, it is clear,
Like that which Miss Danäe managed with Jove,
  Must all be transacted in _bullion_, my dear!

DIALOGUE BETWEEN A SOVEREIGN AND A ONE POUND NOTE.


    _"o ego non felix, quam tu fugis, ut pavet acres
    agna lupos, capreaeque leones."_--HOR.


    Said a Sovereign to a Note,
    In the pocket of his coat,
Where they met in a neat purse of leather,
    "How happens it, I prithee,
    "That, tho' I'm wedded _with_ thee,
"Fair Pound, we can never live together?

    "Like your sex, fond of _change_
    "With Silver you can range,
"And of lots of young sixpences be mother;
    "While with _me_--upon my word,
    "Not my Lady and my Lord
"Of Westmouth see so little of each other!"

    The indignant Note replied
    (Lying crumpled by his side),
"Shame, shame, it is _yourself_ that roam, Sir--
    "One cannot look askance,
    "But, whip! you're off to France,
"Leaving nothing but old rags at home, Sir.

    "Your scampering began
    "From the moment Parson Van,
"Poor man, made us _one_ in Love's fetter;
    "'For better or for worse'
    "Is the usual marriage curse,
"But ours is all 'worse' and no 'better.'

    "In vain are laws past,
    "There's nothing holds you fast,
"Tho' you know, sweet Sovereign, I adore you--
    "At the smallest hint in life,
    "You forsake your lawful wife,
"As _other_ Sovereigns did before you.

    "I flirt with Silver, true--
    "But what can ladies do,
"When disowned by their natural protectors?
    "And as to falsehood, stuff!
    "I shall soon be _false_ enough,
"When I get among those wicked Bank Directors."

    The Sovereign, smiling on her,
    Now swore upon his honor,
To be henceforth domestic and loyal;
    But, within an hour or two,
    Why--I sold him to a Jew,
And he's now at No. 10, Palais Royal.






AN EXPOSTULATION TO LORD KING.


    _"quem das finem, rex magne, laborum?"_
    VERGIL.


1826.


How _can_ you, my Lord, thus delight to torment all
  The Peers of the realm about cheapening their corn,[1]
When you know, if one hasn't a very high rental,
  'Tis hardly worth while being very high born?

Why bore them so rudely, each night of your life,
  On a question, my Lord, there's so much to abhor in?
A question-like asking one, "How is your wife?"--
  At once so confounded _domestic_ and _foreign_.

As to weavers, no matter how poorly they feast;
  But Peers and such animals, fed up for show,
(Like the well-physickt elephant, lately deceased,)
  Take a wonderful quantum of cramming, you know.

You might see, my dear Baron, how bored and distrest
  Were their high noble hearts by your merciless tale,
When the force of the agony wrung even a jest
  From the frugal Scotch wit of my Lord Lauderdale![2]

Bright Peer! to whom Nature and Berwickshire gave
  A humor endowed with effects so provoking,
That when the whole House looks unusually grave
  You may always conclude that Lord Lauderdale's joking!

And then, those unfortunate weavers of Perth--
  Not to know the vast difference Providence dooms
Between weavers of Perth and Peers of high birth,
  'Twixt those who have _heir_looms, and those who've but looms!

"To talk _now_ of starving!"--as great Athol said[3]--
  (And the nobles all cheered and the bishops all wondered,)
"When some years ago he and others had fed
  "Of these same hungry devils about fifteen hundred!"

It follows from hence--and the Duke's very words
  Should be publisht wherever poor rogues of this craft are--
That weavers, _once_ rescued from starving by Lords,
  Are bound to be starved by said Lords ever after.

When Rome was uproarious, her knowing patricians
  Made "Bread and the Circus" a cure for each _row_;
But not so the plan of _our_ noble physicians,
  "No Bread and the Treadmill,"'s the regimen now.

So cease, my dear Baron of Ockham, your prose,
  As I shall my poetry--_neither_ convinces;
And all we have spoken and written but shows,
  When you tread on a nobleman's _corn_,[4]
how he winces.


[1] See the proceedings of the Lords, Wednesday, March 1, 1826,
when Lord King was severely reproved by several of the noble Peers, for
making so many speeches against the Corn Laws.

[2] This noble Earl said, that "when he heard the petition came
from ladies' boot and shoe-makers, he thought it must be against the
'corns' which they inflicted on the fair sex."

[3] The Duke of Athol said, that "at a former period, when these
weavers were in great distress, the landed interest of Perth had supported
1500 of them, it was a poor return for these very men now to petition
against the persons who had fed them."

[4] An improvement, we flatter ourselves, on Lord L.'s joke.






THE SINKING FUND CRIED.


    "Now what, we ask, is become of this Sinking Fund--these eight
    millions of surplus above expenditure, which were to reduce the
    interest of the national debt by the amount of four hundred thousand
    pounds annually? Where, indeed, is the Sinking Fund itself?"
    --_The Times_.


    Take your bell, take your bell,
    Good Crier, and tell
To the Bulls and the Bears, till their ears are stunned,
    That, lost or stolen,
    Or fallen thro' a hole in
The Treasury floor, is the Sinking Fund!

    O yes! O yes!
    Can anybody guess
What the deuce has become of this Treasury wonder?
    It has Pitt's name on't,
    All brass, in the front,
And Robinson's scrawled with a goose-quill under.

    Folks well knew what
    Would soon be its lot,
When Frederick and Jenky set hob-nobbing,[1]
    And said to each other,
    "Suppose, dear brother,
"We make this funny old Fund worth robbing."

    We are come, alas!
    To a very pretty pass--
Eight Hundred Millions of score, to pay,

    With but Five in the till,
    To discharge the bill,
And even that Five, too, whipt away!

    Stop thief! stop thief!--
    From the Sub to the Chief,
These _Gemmen_ of Finance are plundering cattle--
    Call the watch--call Brougham,
    Tell Joseph Hume,
That best of Charleys, to spring his rattle.

    Whoever will bring
    This aforesaid thing
To the well-known House of Robinson and Jenkin,
    Shall be paid, with thanks,
    In the notes of banks,
Whose Funds have all learned "the Art of Sinking."

    O yes! O yes!
    Can anybody guess
What the devil has become of this Treasury wonder?
    It has Pitt's name on't,
    All brass, in the front,
And Robinson's, scrawled with a goose-quill under.

taxes to the sum of five millions.






ODE TO THE GODDESS CERES.

BY SIR THOMAS LETHBRIDGE.


    "legiferoe Cereri Phoeboque."--VERGIL.


Dear Goddess of Corn whom the ancients, we know,
  (Among other odd whims of those comical bodies,)
Adorned with somniferous poppies to show
  Thou wert always a true Country-gentleman's Goddess.

Behold in his best shooting-jacket before thee
  An eloquent 'Squire, who most humbly beseeches.
Great Queen of Mark-lane (if the thing doesnt bore thee),
  Thou'lt read o'er the last of his--_never_-last speeches.

Ah! Ceres, thou knowest not the slander and scorn
  Now heapt upon England's 'Squirearchy, so boasted;
Improving on Hunt,[1] 'tis no longer the Corn,
  'Tis the _growers_ of Corn that are now, alas! roasted.

In speeches, in books, in all shapes they attack us--
  Reviewers, economists--fellows no doubt
That you, my dear Ceres and Venus and Bacchus
  And Gods of high fashion, know little about.

There's Bentham, whose English is all his own making,--
  Who thinks just as little of settling a nation
As he would of smoking his pipe or of taking
  (What he himself calls) his "postprandial vibration."[2]

There are two Mr. Mills to whom those that love reading
  Thro' all that's unreadable call very clever;--
And whereas Mill Senior makes war on _good_ breeding,
  Mill Junior makes war on all _breeding_ whatever!

In short, my dear Goddess, old England's divided
  Between _ultra_ blockheads and superfine sages;--
With _which_ of these classes we landlords have sided
  Thou'lt find in my Speech if thou'lt read a few pages.

For therein I've proved to my own satisfaction
  And that of all 'Squires I've the honor of meeting
That 'tis the most senseless and foul-mouthed detraction
  To say that poor people are fond of cheap eating.

On the contrary, such the "_chaste_ notions"[3] of food
  That dwell in each pale manufacturer's heart,
They would scorn any law, be it ever so good,
  That would make thee, dear Goddess, less dear than thou art!

And, oh! for Monopoly what a blest day,
  Whom the Land and the Silk[4] shall in fond combination
(Like _Sulky_ and _Silky_, that pair in the play,)[5]
  Cry out with one voice for High Rents and Starvation!

Long life to the Minister!--no matter who,
  Or how dull he may be, if with dignified spirit he
Keeps the ports shut--and the people's mouths too--
  We shall all have a long run of Freddy's prosperity,

And, as for myself, who've, like Hannibal, sworn
  To hate the whole crew who would take our rents from us,
Had England but _One_ to stand by thee, Dear Corn,
  That last, honest Uni-Corn[6] would be Sir Thomas!


[1] A sort of "breakfast-power," composed of roasted corn, was
about this time introduced by Mr. Hunt, as a substitute for coffee.

[2] The venerable Jeremy's phrase for his after-dinner walk.

[3] A phrase in one of Sir Thomas's last speeches.

[4] Great efforts were, at that time, making for the exclusion of
foreign silk.

[5] "Road to Ruin."

[6] This is meant not so much for a pun, as in allusion to the natural
history of the Unicorn, which is supposed to be, something between the
_Bos_ and the _Asinus_, and, as Rees's Cyclopaedia assures us,
has a particular liking for everything "chaste."






A HYMN OF WELCOME AFTER THE RECESS.


    _"animas sapientiores fieri quiescendo."_


And now-cross-buns and pancakes o'er--
Hail, Lords and Gentlemen, once more!
  Thrice hail and welcome, Houses Twain!
The short eclipse of April-Day
Having (God grant it!) past away,
  Collective Wisdom, shine again!

Come, Ayes and Noes, thro' thick and thin,--
With Paddy Holmes for whipper-in,--
  Whate'er the job, prepared to back it;
Come, voters of Supplies--bestowers
Of jackets upon trumpet-blowers,
  At eighty mortal pounds the jacket![1]

Come--free, at length, from Joint-Stock cares--
Ye Senators of many Shares,
  Whose dreams of premium knew no boundary;
So fond of aught like _Company_,
That you would even have taken _tea_
  (Had you been askt) with Mr. Goundry.[2]

Come, matchless country-gentlemen;
Come, wise Sir Thomas--wisest then
  When creeds and corn-lords are debated;
Come, rival even the Harlot Red,
And show how wholly into _bread_
  A 'Squire is _transubstantiated_,

Come, Lauderdale, and tell the world,
That--surely as thy scratch is curled
  As never scratch was curled before--
Cheap eating does more harm than good,
And working-people spoiled by food,
  The less they eat, will work the more.

Come, Goulburn, with thy glib defence
(Which thou'dst have made for Peter's Pence)
  Of Church-rates, worthy of a halter;
Two pipes of port (_old_ port, 'twas said
By honest _New_port)[3] bought and paid
  By Papists for the Orange Altar![4]

Come, Horton, with thy plan so merry
For peopling Canada from Kerry--
  Not so much rendering Ireland quiet,
As grafting on the dull Canadians
That liveliest of earth's contagions,
  The _bull_-pock of Hibernian riot!

Come all, in short, ye wondrous men
Of wit and wisdom, come again;
  Tho' short your absence, all deplore it--
Oh, come and show, whate'er men say,
That you can _after_ April-Day,
  Be just as--sapient as _before_ it.


[1] An item of expense which Mr. Hume in vain endeavored tog et rid of:--
trumpeters, it appears like the men of All-Souls, must be "_bene
vestiti_."

[2] The gentleman, lately before the public, who kept his _Joint_-Stock
Tea Company all to himself, singing "Te _solo adoro_."

[3] Sir John Newport.

[4] This charge of two pipes of port for the sacramental wine is a
precious specimen of the sort of rates levied upon their Catholic fellow-
parishioners by the Irish Protestants. "The thirst that from the soul doth
rise Doth ask a drink divine."






MEMORABILIA OF LAST WEEK.

MONDAY, MARCH 13, 1826.


The Budget--quite charming and witty--no hearing,
For plaudits and laughs, the good things that were in it;--
Great comfort to find, tho' the speech isn't _cheering_,
  That all its gay auditors _were_ every minute.

What, _still_ more prosperity!--mercy upon us,
  "This boy'll be the death of me"--oft as, already,
Such smooth Budgeteers have genteelly undone us,
  For _Ruin made easy_ there's no one like Freddy.

TUESDAY.

Much grave apprehension exprest by the Peers,
  Lest--calling to life the old Peachums and Lockitts--
The large stock of gold we're to have in three years,
  Should all find its way into highwaymen's pockets![1]

WEDNESDAY.

Little doing--for sacred, oh Wednesday, thou art
  To the seven-o'-clock joys of full many a table--
When _the Members_ all meet, to make much of that part,
  With which they so rashly fell out in the Fable.

It appeared, tho', to-night, that--as church-wardens yearly,
  Eat up a small baby--those cormorant sinners.
The Bankrupt Commissioners, _bolt_ very nearly
  A moderate-sized bankrupt, _tout chaud_, for their dinners![2]

_Nota bene_--a rumor to-day, in the city,
"Mr. Robinson just has resigned"--what a pity!

The Bulls and the Bears all fell a sobbing,
When they heard of the fate of poor Cock _Robin_:
While thus, to the nursery tune, so pretty,
A murmuring _Stock_-dove breathed her ditty:--

Alas, poor _Robin_, he crowed as long
  And as sweet as a prosperous Cock could crow;
But his _note_ was _small_ and the _gold_-finch's song
  Was a pitch too high for Robin to go.
        Who'll make his shroud?

"I," said the Bank, "tho' he played me a prank,
  "While I have a rag, poor _Rob_ shall be rolled in't,
"With many a pound I'll paper him round,
  "Like a plump rouleau--_without_ the gold in it."


[1] "Another objection to a metallic currency was, that it produced a
greater number of highway robberies."--_Debate in the Lords_.

Commissioners of Bankrupts.






ALL IN THE FAMILY WAY.

A NEW PASTORAL BALLAD.

(SUNG IN THE CHARACTER OF BRITANNIA.)


    "The Public Debt is due from ourselves to ourselves, and resolves
    itself into a Family Account."--_Sir Robert Peel's Letter_.


Tune--_My banks are all furnisht with bees_.


My banks are all furnisht with rags,
  So thick, even Freddy can't thin 'em;
I've torn up my old money-bags,
  Having little or nought to put in 'em.
My tradesmen are smashing by dozens,
  But this is all nothing, they say;
For bankrupts since Adam are cousins,--
  So, it's all in the family way.

My Debt not a penny takes from me.
  As sages the matter explain;--
Bob owes it to Tom, and then Tommy
  Just owes it to Bob back again.
Since all have thus taken to _owing_,
  There's nobody left that can _pay_;
And this is the way to keep going,--
  All quite in the family way.

My senators vote away millions,
  To put in Prosperity's budget;
And tho' it were billions or trillions,
  The generous rogues wouldnt grudge it.
'Tis all but a family _hop_,
  'Twas Pitt began dancing the hay;
Hands round!--why the deuce should we stop?
  'Tis all in the family way.

My laborers used to eat mutton,
  As any great man of the State does;
And now the poor devils are put on
  Small rations of tea and potatoes.
But cheer up, John, Sawney, and Paddy,
  The King is your father, they say;
So even if you starve for your Daddy,
  'Tis all in the family way.

My rich manufacturers tumble,
  My poor ones have nothing to chew;
And even if themselves do not grumble
  Their stomachs undoubtedly do.
But coolly to fast _en famille_,
  Is as good for the soul as to pray;
And famine itself is genteel,
  When one starves in a family way.

I have found out a secret for Freddy,
  A secret for next Budget day;
Tho' perhaps he may know it already,
  As he too's a sage in his way.
When next for the Treasury scene he
  Announces "the Devil to pay,"
Let him write on the bills, "_nota bene_,
  "'Tis all in the family way."






BALLAD FOR THE CAMBRIDGE ELECTION.


    "I authorized my Committee to take the step which they did, of
    proposing a fair comparison of strength, upon the understanding that
    _whichever of the two should prove to be the weakest_, should
    give way to the other."
    --_Extract from Mr. W. J. Bankes's Letter to Mr. Goulbourn_.


Bankes is weak, and Goulbourn too,
  No one e'er the fact denied;--
Which is "weakest" of the two,
  Cambridge can alone decide.
Choose between them, Cambridge, pray,
Which is weakest, Cambridge, say.

Goulbourn of the Pope afraid is,
  Bankes, as much afraid as he;
Never yet did two old ladies
  On this point so well agree.
Choose between them, Cambridge, pray,
Which is weakest. Cambridge, say.

Each a different mode pursues,
  Each the same conclusion reaches;
Bankes is foolish in Reviews,
  Goulbourn foolish in his speeches.
Choose between them, Cambridge, pray,
Which is weakest, Cambridge, say.

Each a different foe doth damn,
  When his own affairs have gone ill;
Bankes he damneth Buckingham,
  Goulbourn damneth Dan O'Connell.
Choose between them, Cambridge, pray,
Which is weakest, Cambridge, say.
Once we know a horse's neigh
  Fixt the election to a throne,
So whichever first shall _bray_
  Choose him, Cambridge, for thy own.
Choose him, choose him by his bray,
Thus elect him, Cambridge, pray.

MR. ROGER DODSWORTH.

1826.


TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.

Sir--Having just heard of the wonderful resurrection of Mr. Roger
Dodsworth from under an _avalanche_, where he had remained, _bien
frappe_, it seems, for the last 166 years, I hasten to impart to you a
few reflections on the subject.--Yours, etc.

    _Laudator Temporis Acti_.


What a lucky turn-up!--just as Eldon's withdrawing,
  To find thus a gentleman, frozen in the year
Sixteen hundred and sixty, who only wants thawing
  To serve for _our_ times quite as well as the Peer;--

To bring thus to light, not the Wisdom alone
  Of our Ancestors, such as 'tis found on our shelves,
But in perfect condition, full-wigged and full-grown,
  To shovel up one of those wise bucks themselves!

Oh thaw Mr. Dodsworth and send him safe home--
  Let him learn nothing useful or new on the way;
With his wisdom kept snug from the light let him come,
  And our Tories will hail him with "Hear!" and "Hurrah!"

What a God-send to _them_!--a good, obsolete man,
  Who has never of Locke or Voltaire been a reader;--
Oh thaw Mr. Dodsworth as fast as you can,
  And the Lonsdales and Hertfords shall choose him for leader.

Yes, Sleeper of Ages, thou _shalt_ be their chosen;
  And deeply with thee will they sorrow, good men,
To think that all Europe has, since thou wert frozen,
  So altered thou hardly wilt know it again.

And Eldon will weep o'er each sad innovation
  Such oceans of tears, thou wilt fancy that he
Has been also laid up in a long congelation,
  And is only now thawing, dear Roger, like thee.






COPY OF AN INTERCEPTED DESPATCH.

FROM HIS EXCELLENCY DON STREPITOSO DIABOLO, ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY TO HIS
SATANIC MAJESTY.

St. James's Street, July 1, 1826.


Great Sir, having just had the good luck to catch
  An official young demon, preparing to go,
Ready booted and spurred, with a black-leg despatch
  From the Hell here at Crockford's, to _our_ Hell below--

I write these few lines to your Highness Satanic,
  To say that first having obeyed your directions
And done all the mischief I could in "the Panic,"
  My next special care was to help the Elections.

Well knowing how dear were those times to thy soul,
  When every good Christian tormented his brother,
And caused, in thy realm, such a saving of coal,
  From all coming down, ready grilled by each other;

Remembering besides how it pained thee to part
  With the old Penal Code--that _chef-d'oeuvre_ of Law,
In which (tho' to own it too modest thou art)
  We could plainly perceive the fine touch of thy claw;

I thought, as we ne'er can those good times revive,
  (Tho' Eldon, with help from your Highness would try,)
'Twould still keep a taste for Hell's music alive,
  Could we get up a thundering No-Popery cry;--

That yell which when chorused by laics and clerics,
  So like is to _ours_, in its spirit and tone.
That I often nigh laugh myself into hysterics,
  To think that Religion should make it her own.

So, having sent down for the original notes
  Of the chorus as sung by your Majesty's choir
With a few pints of lava to gargle the throats
  Of myself and some others who sing it "with fire,"[1]

Thought I, "if the Marseillais Hymn could command
  "Such audience, tho' yelled by a _Sans-culotte_ crew
"What wonders shall _we_ do, who've men in our band,
  "That not only wear breeches but petticoats too."

Such _then_ were my hopes, but with sorrow, your Highness,
  I'm forced to confess--be the cause what it will,
Whether fewness of voices or hoarseness or shyness,--
  Our Beelzebub Chorus has gone off but ill.

The truth is no placeman now knows his right key,
  The Treasury pitch-pipe of late is so various;
And certain _base_ voices, that lookt for a fee
  At the _York_ music-meeting now think it precarious.

Even some of our Reverends _might_ have been warmer,--
  Tho' one or two capital roarers we've had;
Doctor Wise[2]is for instance a charming performer,
  And _Huntingdon_ Maberley's yell was not bad!

Altogether however the thing was not hearty;--
  Even Eldon allows we got on but so so;
And when next we attempt a No-Popery party,
  We _must_, please your Highness, recruit _from below_.

But hark! the young Black-leg is cracking his whip--
  Excuse me, Great Sir-there's no time to be civil;--
The next opportunity shan't be let slip,
  But, till then,
    I'm, in haste, your most dutiful
      DEVIL.

THE MILLENNIUM.

SUGGESTED BY THE LATE WORK OF THE REVEREND MR. IRVING "ON PROPHECY."

1826


A millennium at hand!--I'm delighted to hear it--
  As matters both public and private now go,
With multitudes round us all starving or near it.
  A good, rich Millennium will come _à-propos_.

Only think, Master Fred, what delight to behold,
  Instead of thy bankrupt old City of Rags,
A bran-new Jerusalem built all of gold,
  Sound bullion throughout from the roof to the flags--

A City where wine and cheap corn[1] shall abound--
  A celestial _Cocaigne_ on whose buttery shelves
We may swear the best things of this world will be found,
  As your Saints seldom fail to take care of themselves!

Thanks, reverend expounder of raptures Elysian,
  Divine Squintifobus who, placed within reach
Of two opposite worlds, by a twist of your vision
  Can cast at the same time a sly look at each;--

Thanks, thanks for the hope thou affordest, that we
  May even in our own times a Jubilee share.
Which so long has been promist by prophets like thee,
  And so often postponed, we began to despair.

There was Whiston[2] who learnedly took Prince Eugene
  For the man who must bring the Millennium about;
There's Faber whose pious productions have been
  All belied ere his book's first edition was out;--

There was Counsellor Dobbs, too, an Irish M. P.,
  Who discoursed on the subject with signal _eclat_,
And, each day of his life sat expecting to see
  A Millennium break out in the town of Armagh![3]

There was also--but why should I burden my lay
  With your Brotherses, Southcotes, and names less deserving,
When all past Millenniums henceforth must give way
  To the last new Millennium of Orator Irving.

Go on, mighty man,--doom them all to the shelf,--
  And when next thou with Prophecy troublest thy sconce,
Oh forget not, I pray thee, to prove that thyself
  Art the Beast (Chapter iv.) that sees nine ways at once.


[1] "A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley
for a penny."--Rev. vi.

[2] When Whiston presented to Prince Eugene the Essay in which he
attempted to connect his victories over the Turks with Revelation, the
Prince is said to have replied, that "he was not aware he had ever had
ever had honor of being known to St. John".

[3] Mr. Dobbs was a member of the Irish Parliament, and, on all other
subjects but the Millennium, a very sensible person: he chose Armagh as
the scene of his Millennium on account of the name Armageddon mentioned in
Revelation.






THE THREE DOCTORS.


    _doctoribus loetamur tribus_.


1826.


Tho' many great Doctors there be,
  There are three that all Doctors out-top,
Doctor Eady, that famous M. D.,
  Doctor Southey, and dear Doctor Slop.[1]

The purger, the proser, the bard--
  All quacks in a different style;
Doctor Southey writes books by the yard.
  Doctor Eady writes puffs by the mile![2]

Doctor Slop, in no merit outdone
  By his scribbling or physicking brother,
Can dose us with stuff like the one.
  Ay, and _doze_ us with stuff like the other.

Doctor Eady good company keeps
  With "No Popery" scribes, on the walls;
Doctor Southey as gloriously sleeps
  With "No Popery" scribes on the stalls.

Doctor Slop, upon subjects divine,
  Such bedlamite slaver lets drop,
Taat if Eady should take the _mad_ line,
  He'll be sure of a patient in Slop.

Seven millions of Papists, no less,
  Doctor Southey attacks, like a Turk;
Doctor Eady, less bold, I confess,
  Attacks but his maid-of-all-work

Doctor Southey, for _his_ grand attack,
  Both a laureate and pensioner is;
While poor Doctor Eady, alack,
  Has been _had up_ to Bow-street for his!

And truly, the law does so blunder,
  That tho' little blood has been spilt, he
May probably suffer as, under
  The _Chalking_ Act, _known_ to be guilty.

So much for the merits sublime
  (With whose catalogue ne'er should I stop)
Of the three greatest lights of our time,
  Doctor Eady and Southey and Slop!

Should you ask me, to _which_ of the three
  Great Doctors the preference should fall,
As a matter of course I agree
  Doctor Eady must go to _the wall_.

But as Southey with laurels is crowned,
  And Slop with a wig and a tail is,
Let Eady's bright temples be bound
  With a swingeing "Corona _Muralis_!"[3]


[1] The editor of the Morning Herald, so nicknamed.

[2] Alluding to the display of this doctor's name, in chalk, on all the
walls round the metropolis.

[3] A crown granted as a reward among the Romans to persons who performed
any extraordinary exploits upon wall, such as scaling them, battering
them, etc.--No doubt, writing upon them, to the extent Dr. Eady does,
would equally establish a claim to the honor.






EPITAPH ON A TUFT-HUNTER.


Lament, lament, Sir Isaac Heard,
  Put mourning round thy page, Debrett,
For here lies one who ne'er preferred
  A Viscount to a Marquis yet.

Beside him place the God of Wit,
  Before him Beauty's rosiest girls,
Apollo for a _star_ he'd quit,
  And Love's own sister for an Earl's.

Did niggard fate no peers afford,
  He took of course to peers' relations;
And rather than not sport a Lord
  Put up with even the last creations;

Even Irish names could he but tag 'em
  With "Lord" and "Duke," were sweet to call;
And at a pinch Lord Ballyraggum
  Was better than no Lord at all.

Heaven grant him now some noble nook,
  For rest his soul! he'd rather be
Genteelly damned beside a Duke,
  Than saved in vulgar company.






ODE TO A HAT.


    --_altum aedificat caput_."
    JUVENAL

1826.


Hail, reverent Hat!--sublime mid all
  The minor felts that round thee grovel;--
Thou that the Gods "a Delta" call
  While meaner mortals call the "shovel."
When on thy shape (like pyramid,
  Cut horizontally in two)[1]
I raptured gaze, what dreams unbid
  Of stalls and mitres bless my view!

That brim of brims so sleekly good--
  Not flapt, like dull Wesleyans', down,
But looking (as all churchmen's should)
  Devoutly upward--towards the _crown_.

Gods! when I gaze upon that brim,
  So redolent of Church all over,
What swarms of Tithes in vision dim,--
Some-pig-tailed, some like cherubim,
  With ducklings' wings--around it hover!
Tenths of all dead and living things,
That Nature into being brings,
From calves and corn to chitterlings.

Say, holy Hat, that hast, of cocks,
The very cock most orthodox.
To _which_ of all the well-fed throng
Of Zion,[2] joy'st thou to belong?
Thou'rt _not_ Sir Harcourt Lees's--no-
  For hats grow like the heads that wear 'em:
And hats, on heads like his, would grow
  Particularly _harum-scarum_.

Who knows but thou mayst deck the pate
Of that famed Doctor Ad-mth-te,
(The reverend rat, whom we saw stand
On his hind-legs in Westmoreland,)
Who changed so quick from _blue_ to _yellow_,
  And would from _yellow_ back to _blue_,
And back again, convenient fellow,
  If 'twere his interest so to do.

Or haply smartest of triangles,
  Thou art the hat of Doctor Owen;
The hat that, to his vestry wrangles,
  That venerable priest doth go in,--
And then and there amid the stare
Of all St. Olave's, takes the chair
And quotes with phiz right orthodox
  The example of his reverend brothers,
To prove that priests all fleece their flocks
  And _he_ must fleece as well as others.

Blest Hat! (whoe'er thy lord may be)
Thus low I take off mine to thee,
The homage of a layman's _castor_,
To the spruce _delta_ of his pastor.
Oh mayst thou be, as thou proceedest,
  Still smarter cockt, still brusht the brighter,
Till, bowing all the way, thou leadest
  Thy sleek possessor to a mitre!


[1] So described by a Reverend Historian of the Church:--"A Delta hat like
the horizontal section of a pyramid."--GRANT'S "History of the English
Church."

[2] Archbishop Magee affectionately calls the Church Establishment of
Ireland "the little Zion."






NEWS FOR COUNTRY COUSINS.


Dear Coz, as I know neither you nor Miss Draper,
When Parliament's up, ever take in a paper,
But trust for your news to such stray odds and ends
As you chance to pick up from political friends-
Being one of this well-informed class, I sit down
To transmit you the last newest news that's in town.

As to Greece and Lord Cochrane, things couldn't look better--
His Lordship (who promises now to fight faster)
Has just taken Rhodes and despatched off a letter
To Daniel O'Connell, to make him Grand Master;
Engaging to change the old name, if he can,
From the Knights of St. John to the Knights of St. Dan;--
Or if Dan should prefer (as a still better whim)
Being made the Colossus, 'tis all one to him.

From Russia the last accounts are that the Tsar--
Most generous and kind as all sovereigns are,
And whose first princely act (as you know, I suppose)
Was to give away all his late brother's old clothes[1]--
Is now busy collecting with brotherly care
The late Emperor's nightcaps, and thinks, of bestowing
One nightcap apiece (if he has them to spare)
On all the distinguisht old ladies now going.
(While I write, an arrival from Riga--the "Brothers"--
Having nightcaps on board for Lord Eldon and others.)

Last advices from India--Sir Archy, 'tis thought,
Was near catching a Tartar (the first ever caught
In N. Lat. 2l.)--and his Highness Burmese,
Being very hard prest to shell out the rupees,
And not having rhino sufficient, they say, meant
To pawn his august Golden Foot[2] for the payment.

(How lucky for monarchs, that thus when they choose
Can establish a _running_ account with the Jews!)
The security being what Rothschild calls "goot,"
A loan will be shortly, of course, set _on foot_;
The parties are Rothschild, A. Baring and Co.
With three other great pawnbrokers: each takes a toe,
And engages (lest Gold-foot should give us _leg_-bail,
As he did once before) to pay down _on the nail_.

       *       *       *       *       *

This is all for the present--what vile pens and paper!
Yours truly, dear Cousin--best love to Miss Draper.

_September_, 1826.

by his successor.

A VISION.

BY THE AUTHOR OF "CHRISTABEL."


"Up!" said the Spirit and ere I could pray
One hasty orison, whirled me away
To a Limbo, lying--I wist not where--
Above or below, in earth or air;
For it glimmered o'er with a _doubtful_ light,
One couldn't say whether 'twas day or night;
And 'twas crost by many a mazy track,
One didn't know how to get on or back;
And I felt like a needle that's going astray
(With its _one_ eye out) thro' a bundle of hay;
When the Spirit he grinned, and whispered me,
"Thou'rt now in the Court of Chancery!"

Around me flitted unnumbered swarms
Of shapeless, bodiless, tailless forms;
(Like bottled-up babes that grace the room
Of that worthy knight, Sir Everard Home)--
All of them, things half-killed in rearing;
Some were lame--some wanted _hearing_;
Some had thro' half a century run,
Tho' they hadn't a leg to stand upon.
Others, more merry, as just beginning,
Around on a _point of law_ were spinning;
Or balanced aloft, 'twixt _Bill_ and _Answer_,
Lead at each end, like a tight-rope dancer.
Some were so _cross_ that nothing could please 'em;-
Some gulpt down _affidavits_ to ease 'em--
All were in motion, yet never a one,
Let it _move_ as it might, could ever move _on_,
"These," said the Spirit, "you plainly see,
"Are what they call suits in Chancery!"

I heard a loud screaming of old and young,
Like a chorus by fifty Vellutis sung;
Or an Irish Dump ("the words by Moore ")
At an amateur concert screamed in score;--
So harsh on my ear that wailing fell
Of the wretches who in this Limbo dwell!
It seemed like the dismal symphony
Of the shapes' Aeneas in hell did see;
Or those frogs whose legs a barbarous cook
Cut off and left the frogs in the brook,
To cry all night, till life's last dregs,
"Give us our legs!--give us our legs!"
Touched with the sad and sorrowful scene,
I askt what all this yell might mean,
When the Spirit replied, with a grin of glee,
"'Tis the cry of the Suitors in Chancery!"

I lookt and I saw a wizard rise,[1]
With a wig like a cloud before men's eyes.
In his aged hand he held a wand,
Wherewith he beckoned his embryo band,
And they moved and moved as he waved it o'er,
But they never get on one inch the more.
And still they kept limping to and fro,
Like Ariels round old Prospero--
Saying, "Dear Master, let us go,"
But still old Prospero answered "No."
And I heard the while that wizard elf
Muttering, muttering spells to himself,
While o'er as many old papers he turned,
As Hume e'er moved for or Omar burned.
He talkt of his virtue--"tho' some, less nice,
(He owned with a sigh) preferred his _Vice_"--
And he said, "I think"--"I doubt"--"I hope,"
Called God to witness, and damned the Pope;
With many more sleights of tongue and hand
I couldn't for the soul of me understand.
Amazed and posed, I was just about
To ask his name, when the screams without,
The merciless clack of the imps within,
And that conjuror's mutterings, made such a din,
That, startled, I woke--leapt up in my bed--
Found the Spirit, the imps, and the conjuror fled,
And blest my stars, right pleased to see,
That I wasn't as yet in Chancery.

THE PETITION OF THE ORANGEMEN OF IRELAND.

1826.


To the people of England, the humble Petition
  Of Ireland's disconsolate Orangemen, showing--
That sad, very sad, is our present condition;--
  Our jobbing all gone and our noble selves going;--

That forming one seventh, within a few fractions,
  Of Ireland's seven millions of hot heads and hearts,
We hold it the basest of all base transactions
  To keep us from murdering the other six parts;--

That as to laws made for the good of the many,
  We humbly suggest there is nothing less true;
As all human laws (and our own, more than any)
  Are made _by_ and _for_ a particular few:--

That much it delights every true Orange brother
  To see you in England such ardor evince,
In discussing _which_ sect most tormented the other,
  And burned with most _gusto_ some hundred years since;--

That we love to behold, while old England grows faint,
  Messrs. Southey and Butler nigh coming to blows,
To decide whether Dunstan, that strong-bodied Saint,
  Ever truly and really pulled the De'il's nose;

Whether t'other Saint, Dominic, burnt the De'il's paw--
  Whether Edwy intrigued with Elgiva's odd mother--
And many such points, from which Southey can draw
  Conclusions most apt for our hating each other.

That 'tis very well known this devout Irish nation
  Has now for some ages, gone happily on
Believing in two kinds of Substantiation,
  One party in _Trans_ and the other in _Con_;[1]

That we, your petitioning _Cons_, have in right
  Of the said monosyllable ravaged the lands
And embezzled the goods and annoyed, day and night,
  Both the bodies and souls of the sticklers for _Trans_;--

That we trust to Peel, Eldon, and other such sages,
  For keeping us still in the same state of mind;
Pretty much as the world used to be in those ages,
  When still smaller syllables maddened mankind;--

When the words _ex_ and _per_[2] served as well to annoy
  One's neighbors and friends with, as _con_ and _trans_ now;
And Christians, like Southey, who stickled for _oi_,
  Cut the throats of all Christians who stickled for _ou_.[3]

That relying on England whose kindness already
  So often has helpt us to play this game o'er,
We have got our red coats and our carabines ready,
  And wait but the word to show sport as before.

That as to the expense--the few millions or so,
  Which for all such diversions John Bull has to pay--
'Tis at least a great comfort to John Bull to know
  That to Orangemen's pockets 'twill all find its way.
For which your petitioners ever will pray,
        Etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.


[1] Consubstantiation--the true Reformed belief; at least, the belief of
Luther, and, as Mosheim asserts, of Melancthon also.

[2] When John of Ragusa went to Constantinople (at the time this dispute
between "_ex_" and "_per_" was going on), he found the Turks, we
are told, "laughing at the Christians for being divided by two such
insignificant particles."

[3] The Arian controversy.--Before that time, says Hooker, "in order to be
a sound believing Christian, men were not curious what syllables or
particles of speech they used."






COTTON AND CORN.

A DIALOGUE.


Said Cotton to Corn, t'other day,
  As they met and exchanged a salute--
(Squire Corn in his carriage so gay,
  Poor Cotton half famished on foot):

"Great Squire, if it isn't uncivil
  "To hint at starvation before you,
"Look down on a poor hungry devil,
  "And give him some bread, I implore you!"

Quoth Corn then in answer to Cotton,
  Perceiving he meant to make _free_--
"Low fellow, you've surely forgotten
  "The distance between you and me!

"To expect that we Peers of high birth
  "Should waste our illustrious acres,
"For no other purpose on earth
  "Than to fatten curst calico-makers!--

"That Bishops to bobbins should bend--
  "Should stoop from their Bench's sublimity,
"Great dealers in _lawn_, to befriend
  "Such contemptible dealers in dimity!

"No--vile Manufacture! ne'er harbor
  "A hope to be fed at our boards;--
"Base offspring of Arkwright the barber,
  "What claim canst _thou_ have upon Lords?

"No--thanks to the taxes and debt,
  "And the triumph of paper o'er guineas,
"Our race of Lord Jemmys, as yet,
  "May defy your whole rabble of _Jennys_!"

So saying--whip, crack, and away
  Went Corn in his chaise thro' the throng,
So headlong, I heard them all say,
  "Squire Corn will be _down_ before long."






THE CANONIZATION OF SAINT BUTTERWORTH.


    "A Christian of the best edition."--RABELAIS.


Canonize him!--yea, verily, we'll canonize him,
  Tho' Cant is his hobby and meddling his bliss,
Tho' sages may pity and wits may despise him,
  He'll ne'er make a bit the worse Saint for all this.

Descend, all ye Spirits, that ever yet spread
  The dominion of Humbug o'er land and o'er sea,
Descend on our Butterworth's biblical head,
  Thrice-Great, Bibliopolist, Saint, and M. P.

Come, shade of Joanna, come down from thy sphere.
  And bring little Shiloh--if 'tisn't too far--
Such a sight will to Butterworth's bosom be dear,
  _His_ conceptions and _thine_ being much on a par.

Nor blush, Saint Joanna, once more to behold
  A world thou hast honored by cheating so many;
Thou'lt find still among us one Personage old,
  Who also by tricks and the _Seals_[1] makes a penny.

Thou, too, of the Shakers, divine Mother Lee![2]
  Thy smiles to beatified Butterworth deign;
Two "lights of the Gentiles" are thou, Anne, and he,
  _One_ hallowing Fleet Street, and _t'other_ Toad Lane![3]

The heathen, we know, made their Gods out of wood,
  And Saints may be framed of as handy materials;--
Old women and Butterworths make just as good
As any the Pope ever _bookt_ as Ethereals.

Stand forth, Man of Bibles!--not Mahomet's pigeon,
  When perched on the Koran, he dropt there, they say,
Strong marks of his faith, ever shed o'er religion
  Such glory as Butterworth sheds every day.

Great Galen of souls, with what vigor he crams
  Down Erin's idolatrous throats, till they crack again,
Bolus on bolus, good man!--and then damns
  Both their stomachs and souls, if they dare cast them back again.

How well might his shop--as a type representing
  The creed of himself and his sanctified clan--
On its counter exhibit "the Art of Tormenting,"
  Bound neatly, and lettered "Whole Duty of Man!"

Canonize him!--by Judas, we _will_ canonize him;
  For Cant is his hobby and twaddling his bliss;
And tho' wise men may pity and wits may despise him,
  He'll make but the better _shop_-saint for all this.

Call quickly together the whole tribe of Canters,
  Convoke all the _serious_ Tag-rag of the nation;
Bring Shakers and Snufflers and Jumpers and Ranters
  To witness their Butterworth's Canonization!

Yea, humbly I've ventured his merits to paint,
  Yea, feebly have tried all his gifts to portray,
And they form a sum-total for making a Saint.
  That the Devil's own advocate could not gainsay.

Jump high, all ye Jumpers, ye Ranters all roar,
  While Butterworth's spirit, upraised from your eyes,
Like a kite made of foolscap, in glory shall soar,
  With a long tail of rubbish behind, to the skies!

AN INCANTATION.

SUNG BY THE BUBBLE SPIRIT.


Air.--_Come with me, and we will go
         Where the rocks of coral grow_.


Come with me and we will blow
Lots of bubbles as we go;
Bubbles bright as ever Hope
Drew from fancy--or from soap;
Bright as e'er the South Sea sent
From its frothy element!
Come with me and we will blow
Lots of bubbles as we go.
Mix the lather, Johnny Wilks,
Thou, who rhym'st so well to bilks;[1]
Mix the lather--who can be
Fitter for such tasks than thee,
Great M. P. for _Suds_bury!

Now the frothy charm is ripe,
Puffing Peter,[2] bring thy pipe,--
Thou whom ancient Coventry
Once so dearly loved that she
Knew not which to her was sweeter,
Peeping Tom or Puffing Peter;--
Puff the bubbles high in air,
Puff thy best to keep them there.

Bravo, bravo, Peter More!
Now the rainbow humbugs[3] soar.
Glittering all with golden hues
Such as haunt the dreams of Jews;--
Some reflecting mines that lie
Under Chili's glowing sky,
Some, those virgin pearls that sleep
Cloistered in the southern deep;
Others, as if lent a ray
From the streaming Milky Way,
Glistening o'er with curds and whey
From the cows of Alderney.

Now's the moment--who shall first
Catch the bubbles ere they burst?
Run, ye Squires, ye Viscounts, run,
Brogden, Teynham, Palmerston;--
John Wilks junior runs beside ye!
Take the good the knaves provide ye!
See, with upturned eyes and hands,
Where the _Share_man, Brogden, stands,
Gaping for the froth to fall
Down his gullet--_lye_ and all.
See!--

    But, hark, my time is out--
Now, like some great water-spout,
Scattered by the cannon's thunder,
Burst ye bubbles, all asunder!

[_Here the stage darkens--a discordant crash is heard from the orchestra
--the broken bubbles descend in a saponaceous but uncleanly mist over the
heads of the_ Dramatis Personae_, and the scene drops, leaving the
bubble-hunters--all in the suds_.]

A DREAM OF TURTLE.

BY SIR W. CURTIS.

1826.


'Twas evening time, in the twilight sweet
I sailed along, when--whom should I meet
But a Turtle journeying o'er the sea,
"On the service of his Majesty."[1]
When spying him first thro' twilight dim,
I didn't know what to make of him;
But said to myself, as slow he plied
His fins and rolled from side to side
Conceitedly o'er the watery path--
"'Tis my Lord of Stowell taking a bath,
"And I hear him now, among the fishes,
"Quoting Vatel and Burgersdicius!"
But, no--'twas, indeed, a Turtle wide
And plump as ever these eyes descried;
A turtle juicy as ever yet
Glued up the lips of a Baronet!
And much did it grieve my soul to see
That an animal of such dignity,
Like an absentee abroad should roam,
When he _ought_ to stay and be ate at home.

But now "a change came o'er my dream,"
  Like the magic lantern's shifting slider;
I lookt and saw by the evening beam
  On the back of that Turtle sat a rider--
A goodly man with an eye so merry,
I knew 'twas our Foreign Secretary,[2]
Who there at his ease did sit and smile,
Like Waterton on his crocodile;[3]
Cracking such jokes, at every motion,
  As made the Turtle squeak with glee
And own they gave him a lively notion
  Of what his _forced_-meat balls would be.
So, on the Sec. in his glory went.
Over that briny element,
Waving his hand as he took farewell
With graceful air, and bidding me tell
Inquiring friends that the Turtle and he
Were gone on a foreign embassy--
To soften the heart of a _Diplomat_,
Who is known to dote upon verdant fat,
And to let admiring Europe see,
That _calipash_ and _calipee_
Are the English forms of Diplomacy.


[1] We are told that the passport of this grand diplomatic Turtle (sent by
the Secretary for Foreign Affairs to a certain noble envoy) described him
as "on his majesty's service."

[2] Mr. Canning.

Mr. Waterton] I was ever on a crocodile's back."






THE DONKEY AND HIS PANNIERS.

A FABLE.


    --_"fessus jam sudat asellus,
    "parce illi; vestrum delicium est asinus."_
    VERGIL. _Copa_.


A donkey whose talent for burdens was wondrous,
  So much that you'd swear he rejoiced in a load,
One day had to jog under panniers so ponderous,
  That--down the poor Donkey fell smack on the road!

His owners and drivers stood round in amaze
  What! Neddy, the patient, the prosperous Neddy,
So easy to drive thro' the dirtiest ways
  For every description of job-work so ready!

One driver (whom Ned might have "hailed" as a "brother")[1]
  Had just been proclaiming his Donkey's renown
For vigor, for spirit, for one thing or other--
  When, lo! mid his praises the Donkey came down!
But how to upraise him?--_one_ shouts, _t'other_ whistles,
  While Jenky, the Conjuror, wisest of all,
Declared that an "over-production of thistles[2]--
  (Here Ned gave a stare)--was the cause of his fall."

Another wise Solomon cries as he passes--
  "There, let him alone and the fit will soon cease;
"The beast has been fighting with other jack-asses,
  "And this is his mode of '_transition to peace_.'"

Some lookt at his hoofs, and with learned grimaces
  Pronounced that too long without shoes he had gone--
"Let the blacksmith provide him a _sound metal basis_,"
  (The wise-acres said), "and he's sure to jog on."

Meanwhile, the poor Neddy in torture and fear
  Lay under his panniers, scarce able to groan;
And--what was still dolefuller--lending an ear
  To advisers whose ears were a match for his own.

At length a plain rustic whose wit went so far
  As to see others' folly, roared out, as he past--
"Quick--off with the panniers, all dolts as ye are,
  "Or your prosperous Neddy will soon kick his last!"

ODE TO THE SUBLIME PORTE.

1826.


Great Sultan, how wise are thy state compositions!
  And oh! above all I admire that Decree,
In which thou command'st that all _she_ politicians
  Shall forthwith be strangled and cast in the sea.

'Tis my fortune to know a lean Benthamite spinster--
  A maid who her faith in old Jeremy puts,
Who talks with a lisp of "the last new West_minster_,"
  And hopes you're delighted with "Mill upon Gluts;"

Who tells you how clever one Mr. Funblank is,
  How charming his Articles 'gainst the Nobility;--
And assures you that even a gentleman's rank is
  In Jeremy's school, of no sort of _utility_.

To see her, ye Gods, a new Number perusing--
  ART. 1.--"On the _Needle's_ variations," by Pl--ce;[1]
  ART. 2.--By her Favorite Funblank[2]--"so amusing!
  "Dear man! he makes Poetry quite a _Law_ case."

ART. 3.--"Upon Fallacies," Jeremy's own--
  (Chief Fallacy being his hope to find readers);-
ART. 4.--"Upon Honesty," author unknown;--
  ART. 5.--(by the young Mr. Mill) "Hints to Breeders."

Oh, Sultan, oh, Sultan, tho' oft for the bag
  And the bowstring, like thee, I am tempted to call--
Tho' drowning's too good for each blue-stocking hag,
  I would bag this _she_ Benthamite first of them all!

And lest she should ever again lift her head
  From the watery bottom, her clack to renew--
As a clog, as a sinker, far better than lead,
  I would hang around her neck her own darling Review.

CORN AND CATHOLICS.


    _utrum horum
    dirius_ borun? _Incerti Auctoris_.


What! _still_ those two infernal questions,
  That with our meals our slumbers mix--
That spoil our tempers and digestions--
  Eternal Corn and Catholics!

Gods! were there ever two such bores?
  Nothing else talkt of night or morn--
Nothing _in_ doors or _out_ of doors,
  But endless Catholics and Corn!

Never was such a brace of pests--
  While Ministers, still worse than either,
Skilled but in feathering their nests,
  Plague us with both and settle neither.

So addled in my cranium meet
  Popery and Corn that oft I doubt,
Whether, this year, 'twas bonded Wheat,
  Or bonded Papists, they let out.

_Here_, landlords, _here_ polemics nail you,
  Armed with all rubbish they can rake up;
_Prices_ and _Texts_ at once assail you--
  From Daniel _these_, and _those_ from Jacob,

And when you sleep, with head still torn
  Between the two, their shapes you mix,
Till sometimes Catholics seem Corn--
  Then Corn again seems Catholics.

Now Dantsic wheat before you floats--
  Now Jesuits from California--
Now Ceres linkt with Titus _Oats_,
  Comes dancing thro' the "Porta _Corn_ea."[1]

Oft too the Corn grows animate,
  And a whole crop of heads appears,
Like Papists, _bearding_ Church and State--
  Themselves, together _by the ears_!

In short these torments never cease,
  And oft I wish myself transferred off
To some far, lonely land of peace
  Where Corn or Papists ne'er were heard of.

Yes, waft me, Parry, to the Pole;
  For--if my fate is to be chosen
'Twixt bores and icebergs--on my soul,
  I'd rather, of the two, be frozen!

A CASE OF LIBEL.


    "The greater the truth, the worse the libel."


A certain Sprite, who dwells below,
  ('Twere a libel perhaps to mention where,)
Came up _incog_. some years ago
  To try for a change the London air.

So well he lookt and drest and talkt,
  And hid his tail and horns so handy,
You'd hardly have known him as he walkt
  From C----e, or any other Dandy.

(His horns, it seems, are made to unscrew;
  So he has but to take them out of the socket,
And--just as some fine husbands do--
  Conveniently clap them into his pocket.)

In short, he lookt extremely natty,
  And even contrived--to his own great wonder--
By dint of sundry scents from Gattie,
  To keep the sulphurous _hogo_ under.

And so my gentleman hoofed about,
  Unknown to all but a chosen few
At White's and Crockford's, where no doubt
  He had many _post-obits_ falling due.

Alike a gamester and a wit,
  At night he was seen with Crockford's crew,
At morn with learned dames would sit--
  So past his time 'twixt _black_ and _blue_.

Some wisht to make him an M. P.,
  But, finding Wilks was also one, he
Swore, in a rage, "he'd be damned, if he
  "Would ever sit in one house with Johnny."

At length as secrets travel fast,
  And devils, whether he or she,
Are sure to be found out at last,
  The affair got wind most rapidly.

The Press, the impartial Press, that snubs
  Alike a fiend's or an angel's capers--
Miss Paton's soon as Beelzebub's,
  Fired off a squib in the morning papers:

"We warn good men to keep aloof
  "From a grim old Dandy seen about
"With a fire-proof wig and a cloven hoof
  "Thro' a neat-cut Hoby smoking out."

Now,--the Devil being gentleman,
  Who piques himself on well-bred dealings,--
You may guess, when o'er these lines he ran,
  How much they hurt and shockt his feelings.

Away he posts to a Man of Law,
  And 'twould make you laugh could you have seen 'em,
As paw shook hand, and hand shook paw,
  And 'twas "hail, good fellow, well met," between 'em.

Straight an indictment was preferred--
  And much the Devil enjoyed the jest,
When, asking about the Bench, he heard
  That, of all the Judges, his own was _Best_.[1]

In vain Defendant proffered proof
  That Plaintiff's self was the Father of Evil--
Brought Hoby forth to swear to the hoof
  And Stultz to speak to the tail of the Devil.

The Jury (saints, all snug and rich,
  And readers of virtuous Sunday papers)
Found for the Plaintiff--on hearing which
  The Devil gave one of his loftiest capers.

For oh, 'twas nuts to the Father of Lies
  (As this wily fiend is named in the Bible)
To find it settled by laws so wise,
  That the greater the truth, the worse the libel!

Good hacks who, if posed for a rhyme or a reason.

THE IRISH SLAVE.[1]

1827.


I heard as I lay, a wailing sound,
  "He is dead--he is dead," the rumor flew;
And I raised my chain and turned me round,
  And askt, thro' the dungeon-window, "Who?"

I saw my livid tormentors pass;
  Their grief 'twas bliss to hear and see!
For never came joy to them alas!
  That didn't bring deadly bane to me.

Eager I lookt thro' the mist of night,
  And askt, "What foe of my race hath died?
"Is it he--that Doubter of law and right,
  "Whom nothing but wrong could e'er decide--

"Who, long as he sees but wealth to win,
  "Hath never yet felt a qualm or doubt
"What suitors for justice he'd keep in,
  "Or what suitors for freedom he'd shut out--

"Who, a clog for ever on Truth's advance,
  "Hangs round her (like the Old Man of the Sea
"Round Sinbad's neck[2]), nor leaves a chance
  "Of shaking him off--is't he? is't he?"

Ghastly my grim tormentors smiled,
  And thrusting me back to my den of woe,
With a laughter even more fierce and wild
  Than their funeral howling, answered "No."

But the cry still pierced my prison-gate,
  And again I askt, "What scourge is gone?
"Is it he--that Chief, so coldly great,
  "Whom Fame unwillingly shines upon--

"Whose name is one of the ill-omened words
  "They link with hate on his native plains;
"And why?--they lent him hearts and swords,
  "And he in return gave scoffs and chains!

"Is it he? is it he?" I loud inquired,
  When, hark!--there sounded a Royal knell;
And I knew what spirit had just expired,
  And slave as I was my triumph fell.

He had pledged a hate unto me and mine,
  He had left to the future nor hope nor choice,
But sealed that hate with a Name Divine,
  And he now was dead and--I _couldn't_ rejoice!

He had fanned afresh the burning brands
  Of a bigotry waxing cold and dim;
He had armed anew my torturers' hands,
  And _them_ did I curse--but sighed for him.

For, _his_ was the error of head not heart;
  And--oh! how beyond the ambushed foe,
Who to enmity adds the traitor's part,
  And carries a smile with a curse below!

If ever a heart made bright amends
  For the fatal fault of an erring head--
Go, learn _his_ fame from the lips of friends,
  In the orphan's tear be his glory read.

A Prince without pride, a man without guile,
  To the last unchanging, warm, sincere,
For Worth he had ever a hand and smile,
  And for Misery ever his purse and tear.

Touched to the heart by that solemn toll,
  I calmly sunk in my chains again;
While, still as I said, "Heaven rest his soul!"
  My mates of the dungeon sighed "Amen!"

ODE TO FERDINAND.

1827.


Quit the sword, thou King of men,
Grasp the needle once again;
Making petticoats is far
Safer sport than making war;
Trimming is a better thing,
Than the _being_ trimmed, oh King!
Grasp the needle bright with which
Thou didst for the Virgin stitch
Garment, such as ne'er before
Monarch stitched or Virgin wore,
Not for her, oh semster nimble!
Do I now invoke thy thimble;
Not for her thy wanted aid is,
But for certain grave old ladies,
Who now sit in England's cabinet,
Waiting to be clothed in tabinet,
Or whatever choice _étoffe_ is
Fit for Dowagers in office.
First, thy care, oh King, devote
To Dame Eldon's petticoat.
Make it of that silk whose dye
Shifts for ever to the eye,
Just as if it hardly knew
Whether to be pink or blue.
Or--material fitter yet--
If thou couldst a remnant get
Of that stuff with which, of old,
Sage Penelope, we're told,
Still by doing and undoing,
Kept her _suitors_ always wooing--
That's the stuff which I pronounce, is
Fittest for Dame Eldon's flounces.

After this, we'll try thy hand,
Mantua-making Ferdinand,
For old Goody Westmoreland;
One who loves, like Mother Cole,
Church and State with all her soul;
And has past her life in frolics
Worthy of our Apostolics.
Choose, in dressing this old flirt,
Something that won't show the dirt,
As, from habit, every minute
Goody Westmoreland is in it.

This is all I now shall ask,
Hie thee, monarch, to thy task;
Finish Eldon's frills and borders,
Then return for further orders.
Oh what progress for our sake,
Kings in millinery make!
Ribands, garters, and such things,
Are supplied by _other_ Kings--
Ferdinand his rank denotes
By providing petticoats.






HAT _VERSUS_ WIG.

1827.


    "At the interment of the Duke of York, Lord Eldon, in order to guard
    against the effects of the damp, stood upon his hat during the whole
    of the ceremony."


     --_metus omnes et inexorabile fatum
    subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis
    avari_.


'Twixt Eldon's Hat and Eldon's Wig
  There lately rose an altercation,--
Each with its own importance big,
  Disputing _which_ most serves the nation.

Quoth Wig, with consequential air,
  "Pooh! pooh! you surely can't design,
"My worthy beaver, to compare
  "Your station in the state with mine.

"Who meets the learned legal crew?
  "Who fronts the lordly Senate's pride?
"The Wig, the Wig, my friend--while you
  "Hang dangling on some peg outside.

"Oh! 'tis the Wig, that rules, like Love,
  "Senate and Court, with like _éclat_--
"And wards below and lords above,
  "For Law is Wig and Wig is Law!

"Who tried the long, _Long_ WELLESLEY suit,
  "Which tried one's patience, in return?
"Not thou, oh Hat!--tho' _couldst_ thou do't,
  "Of other _brims_[1] than thine thou'dst learn.

"'Twas mine our master's toil to share;
  "When, like 'Truepenny,' in the play,[2]
"He, every minute, cried out 'Swear,'
  "And merrily to swear went they;--[3]

"When, loath poor WELLESLEY to condemn, he
  "With nice discrimination weighed,
"Whether 'twas only 'Hell and Jemmy,'
  Or 'Hell and Tommy' that he played.

"No, no, my worthy beaver, no--
  "Tho' cheapened at the cheapest hatter's,
"And smart enough as beavers go
  "Thou ne'er wert made for public matters."

Here Wig concluded his oration,
  Looking, as wigs do, wondrous wise;
While thus, full cockt for declamation,
  The veteran Hat enraged replies:--

"Ha! dost thou then so soon forget
  "What thou, what England owes to me?
"Ungrateful Wig!--when will a debt,
  "So deep, so vast, be owed thee?

"Think of that night, that fearful night,
  "When, thro' the steaming vault below,
"Our master dared, in gout's despite,
  "To venture his podagric toe!

"Who was it then, thou boaster, say
  "When thou hadst to thy box sneaked off,
"Beneath his feet protecting lay,
  "And saved him from a mortal cough?

"Think, if Catarrh had quenched that sun,
  "How blank this world had been to thee!
"Without that head to shine upon,
  "Oh Wig, where would thy glory be?

"You, too, ye Britons,--had this hope
  "Of Church and State been ravisht from ye,
"Oh think, how Canning and the Pope
  "Would then have played up 'Hell and Tommy'!

"At sea, there's but a plank, they say,
  "'Twixt seamen and annihilation;
"A Hat, that awful moment, lay
  "'Twixt England and Emancipation!

"Oh!!!--"

At this "Oh!!!" _The Times_ Reporter
  Was taken poorly, and retired;
Which made him cut Hat's rhetoric shorter,
  Than justice to the case required.

On his return, he found these shocks
  Of eloquence all ended quite;
And Wig lay snoring in his box,
  And Hat was--hung up for the night.


[1] "_Brim_--a naughty woman."--GROSE.

[2]"_Ghost_[beneath].--Swear!

THE PERIWINKLES AND THE LOCUSTS.

A SALMAGUNDIAN HYMN.


    "To Panurge was assigned the Laird-ship of Salmagundi, which was
    yearly worth 6,789,106,789 ryals besides the revenue of the
    _Locusts_ and _Periwinkles_, amounting one year with another
    to the value of 2,485,768," etc.--RABELAIS.


"Hurra! hurra!" I heard them say,
And they cheered and shouted all the way,
As the Laird of Salmagundi went.
To open in state his Parliament.

The Salmagundians once were rich,
Or thought they were--no matter which--
For, every year, the Revenue
From their Periwinkles larger grew;
And their rulers, skilled in all the trick
And legerdemain of arithmetic,
Knew how to place 1, 2, 3, 4,
  5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 and 10,
Such various ways, behind, before,
That they made a unit seem a score,
  And proved themselves most wealthy men!
So, on they went, a prosperous crew,
  The people wise, the rulers clever--
And God help those, like me and you,
Who dared to doubt (as some now do)
That the Periwinkle Revenue
  Would thus go flourishing on for ever.

"Hurra! hurra!" I heard them say,
And they cheered and shouted all the way,
As the Great Panurge in glory went
To open his own dear Parliament.

But folks at length began to doubt
What all this conjuring was about;
For, every day, more deep in debt
They saw their wealthy rulers get:--
"Let's look (said they) the items thro'
"And see if what we're told be true
"Of our Periwinkle Revenue,"
But, lord! they found there wasn't a tittle
  Of truth in aught they heard before;
For they gained by Periwinkles little
  And lost by Locusts ten times more!
These Locusts are a lordly breed
Some Salmagundians love to feed.
Of all the beasts that ever were born,
Your Locust most delights in _corn_;
And tho' his body be but small,
To fatten him takes the devil and all!
"Oh fie! oh fie!" was now the cry,
As they saw the gaudy show go by,
As the Laird of Salmagundi went
To open his Locust Parliament!






NEW CREATION OF PEERS.

BATCH THE FIRST.


    "His 'prentice han'
    He tried on man,
    And then he made the lasses."


1827.


"And now," quoth the Minister, (eased of his panics,
  And ripe for each pastime the summer affords,)
"Having had our full swing at destroying mechanics,
  "By way of _set-off_, let us make a few Lords.

"'Tis pleasant--while nothing but mercantile fractures,
  "Some simple, some _compound_, is dinned in our ears--
"To think that, tho' robbed all coarse manufactures,
  "We still have our fine manufacture of Peers;--

"Those _Gotielin_ productions which Kings take a pride
  "In engrossing the whole fabrication and trade of;
"Choice tapestry things very grand on _one_ side,
  "But showing, on t'other, what rags they are made of.

The plan being fixt, raw material was sought,--
  No matter how middling, if Tory the creed be;
And first, to begin with, Squire W---, 'twas thought,
  For a Lord was as raw a material as need be.

Next came with his _penchant_ for painting and pelf
  The tasteful Sir Charles,[1] so renowned far and near
For purchasing pictures and selling himself--
  And _both_ (as the public well knows) very dear.

Beside him Sir John comes, with equal _éclat_, in;--
  Stand forth, chosen pair, while for titles we measure ye;
Both connoisseur baronets, both fond of _drawing_,
  Sir John, after nature, Sir Charles, on the Treasury.

But, bless us!--behold a new candidate come--
  In his hand he upholds a prescription, new written:
He poiseth a pill-box 'twixt finger and thumb,
  And he asketh a seat 'mong the Peers of Great Britain!

"Forbid it," cried Jenky, "ye Viscounts, ye Earls!
  "Oh Rank, how thy glories would fall disenchanted,
"If coronets glistend with pills stead of pearls,
  "And the strawberry-leaves were by rhubarb supplanted!

"No--ask it not, ask it not, dear Doctor Holford--
  "If naught but a Peerage can gladden thy life,
"And young Master Holford as yet is too small for't,
  "Sweet Doctor, we'll make a _she_ Peer of thy wife.

"Next to bearing a coronet on our _own_ brows
  "Is to bask in its light from the brows of another;
"And grandeur o'er thee shall reflect from thy spouse,
  "As o'er Vesey Fitzgerald 'twill shine thro' his mother."[2]

Thus ended the _First_ Batch--and Jenky, much tired
  (It being no joke to make Lords by the heap),
Took a large dram of ether--the same that inspired
  His speech 'gainst the Papists--and prosed off to sleep.


[1] Created Lord Farnborough.

[2] Among the persons mentioned as likely to be raised to the
Peerage are the mother of Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald, etc.






SPEECH ON THE UMBRELLA QUESTION.[1]

BY LORD ELDON.

1827.


    "_vos_ inumbrelles _video_."--_Ex Juvenil_.
    GEORGII CANNINGII.[2]


My Lords, I'm accused of a trick that God knows is
  The last into which at my age I could fall--
Of leading this grave House of Peers by their noses,
  Wherever I choose, princes, bishops and all.

My Lords, on the question before us at present,
  No doubt I shall hear, "'Tis that cursed old fellow,
"That bugbear of all that is liberal and pleasant,
  "Who won't let the Lords give the man his umbrella!"

God forbid that your Lordships should knuckle to me;
  I am ancient--but were I as old as King Priam,
Not much, I confess, to your credit 'twould be,
  To mind such a twaddling old Trojan as I am.

I own, of our Protestant laws I am jealous,
  And long as God spares me will always maintain,
That _once_ having taken men's rights, or umbrellas,
  We ne'er should consent to restore them again.

What security have you, ye Bishops and Peers,
  If thus you give back Mr. Bell's _parapluie_,
That he mayn't with its stick, come about all your ears,
  And then--_where_ would your Protestant periwigs be?

No! heaven be my judge, were I dying to-day,
  Ere I dropt in the grave, like a medlar that's mellow,
"For God's sake"--at that awful moment I'd say--
  "For God's sake, _don't_ give Mr. Bell his umbrella."

["This address," says a ministerial journal, "delivered with amazing
emphasis and earnestness, occasioned an extraordinary sensation in the
House. Nothing since the memorable address of the Duke of York has
produced so remarkable an impression."]

gentleman, of the name, of Bell, having left his umbrella behind him in
the House of Lords, the doorkeepers (standing, no doubt, on the privileges
of that noble body) refused to restore it to him; and the above speech,
which may be considered as a _pendant_ to that of the Learned Earl on
the Catholic Question, arose out of the transaction.

A PASTORAL BALLAD.

BY JOHN BULL.


    _Dublin, March 12, 1827_.--Friday, after the arrival of the
    packet bringing the account of the defeat of the Catholic Question, in
    the House of Commons, orders were sent to the Pigeon-House to forward
    5,000,000 rounds of musket-ball cartridge to the different garrisons
    round the country.--_Freeman's Journal_.


I have found out a gift for my Erin,
  A gift that will surely content her:--
Sweet pledge of a love so endearing!
  Five millions of bullets I've sent her.

She askt me for Freedom and Right,
  But ill she her wants understood;--
Ball cartridges, morning and night,
  Is a dose that will do her more good.

There is hardly a day of our lives
  But we read, in some amiable trials,
How husbands make love to their wives
  Thro' the medium of hemp and of vials.

_One_ thinks, with his mistress or mate
  A good halter is sure to agree--
That love-knot which, early and late,
  I have tried, my dear Erin, on thee.

While _another_, whom Hymen has blest
  With a wife that is not over placid,
Consigns the dear charmer to rest,
  With a dose of the best Prussic acid.

Thus, Erin! my love do I show--
  Thus quiet thee, mate of my bed!
And, as poison and hemp are too slow,
  Do thy business with bullets instead.

Should thy faith in my medicine be shaken,
  Ask Roden, that mildest of saints;
He'll tell thee, lead, inwardly taken,
  Alone can remove thy complaints;--

That, blest as thou art in thy lot,
  Nothing's wanted to make it more pleasant
But being hanged, tortured and shot,
  Much oftener than thou art at present.

Even Wellington's self hath averred
  Thou art yet but half sabred and hung,
And I loved him the more when I heard
  Such tenderness fall from his tongue.

So take the five millions of pills,
  Dear partner, I herewith inclose;
'Tis the cure that all quacks for thy ill,
  From Cromwell to Eldon, propose.

And you, ye brave bullets that go,
  How I wish that, before you set out,
The _Devil_ of the Freischütz could know
  The good work you are going about.

For he'd charm ye, in spite of your lead.
  Into such supernatural wit.
That you'd all of you know, as you sped,
  Where a bullet of sense _ought_ to hit.






A LATE SCENE AT SWANAGE.[1]


    _regnis_ EX _sul ademptis_.--Verg. 1827.


To Swanage--that neat little town in whose bay
  Fair Thetis shows off in her best silver slippers--
Lord Bags[2] took his annual trip t'other day,
  To taste the sea breezes and chat with the dippers.

There--learned as he is in conundrums and laws--
  Quoth he to his dame (whom he oft plays the wag on),
  "Why are chancery suitors like bathers?"--"Because
  Their _suits_ are _put off_, till they haven't a rag on."

Thus on he went chatting--but, lo! while he chats,
  With a face full of wonder around him he looks;
For he misses his parsons, his dear shovel hats,
  Who used to flock round him at Swanage like rooks.

"How is this, Lady Bags?--to this region aquatic
"Last year they came swarming to make me their bow,
"As thick as Burke's cloud o'er the vales of Carnatic,
"Deans, Rectors, D.D.'s--where the devil are they now?"

"My dearest Lord Bags!" saith his dame, "_can_ you doubt?
  "I am loath to remind you of things so unpleasant;
"But _don't_ you perceive, dear, the Church have found out
  "That you're one of the people called _Ex's_, at present?"

"Ah, true--you have hit it--I _am_, indeed, one
  "Of those ill-fated _Ex's_ (his Lordship replies),
"And with tears, I confess--God forgive me the pun!--
  "We X's have proved ourselves _not_ to be Y's."


[1] A small bathing-place on the coast of Dorsetshire, long a favorite
summer resort of the ex-nobleman in question and, _till this season_, much
frequented also by gentlemen of the church.

WO! WO![1]


Wo, wo unto him who would check or disturb it--
  That beautiful Light which is now on its way;
Which beaming, at first, o'er the bogs of Belturbet,
  Now brightens sweet Ballinafad with its ray!

Oh Farnham, Saint Farnham, how much do we owe thee!
  How formed to all tastes are thy various employs.
The old, as a catcher of Catholics, know thee;
  The young, as an amateur scourger of boys.

Wo, wo to the man who such doings would smother!--
  On, Luther of Bavan! On, Saint of Kilgroggy!
With whip in one hand and with Bible in t'other,
  Like Mungo's tormentor, both "preachee and floggee."

Come, Saints from all quarters, and marshal his way;
  Come, Lorton, who, scorning profane erudition,
Popt Shakespeare, they say, in the river one day,
  Tho' 'twas only old Bowdler's _Velluti_ edition.

Come, Roden, who doubtest--so mild are thy views--
  Whether Bibles or bullets are best for the nation;
Who leav'st to poor Paddy no medium to choose
  'Twixt good _old_ Rebellion and _new_ Reformation.

What more from her Saints can Hibernia require?
  St. Bridget of yore like a dutiful daughter
Supplied her, 'tis said, with perpetual fire,[2]
  And Saints keep her _now_ in eternal hot water.

Wo, wo to the man who would check their career,
  Or stop the Millennium that's sure to await us,
When blest with an orthodox crop every year,
  We shall learn to raise Protestants fast as potatoes.

In kidnapping Papists, our rulers, we know,
  Had been trying their talent for many a day;
Till Farnham, when all had been tried, came to show,
  Like the German flea-catcher, "anoder goot way."

And nothing's more simple than Farnham's receipt;--
  "Catch your Catholic, first--soak him well in _poteen_,
"Add _salary_ sauce,[3] and the thing is complete.
  "You may serve up your Protestant smoking and clean."

"Wo, wo to the wag, who would laugh at such cookery!"
  Thus, from his perch, did I hear a black crow[4]
Caw angrily out, while the rest of the rookery
  Opened their bills and re-echoed "Wo! wo!"


[1] Suggested by a speech of the Bishop of Chester on the subject of the
New Reformation in Ireland, in which his Lordship denounced "Wo! Wo! Wo!"
pretty abundantly on all those who dared to interfere with its progress.

[2] The inextenguishable fire of St. Bridget, at Kildare.

Protestant clergymen of this town by fellows, inquiring 'What are they
giving a head for converts?'"--_Wexford Post_.

corn.






TOUT POUR LA TRIPE.


    "If in China or among the natives of India, we claimed civil
    advantages which were connected with religious usages, little as
    we might value those forms in our hearts, we should think common
    decency required us to abstain from treating them with offensive
    contumely; and, though unable to consider them sacred, we would not
    sneer at the name of _Fot_, or laugh at the imputed divinity
    of _Visthnou_."--_Courier, Tuesday. Jan_. 16.


1827.


Come take my advice, never trouble your cranium,
  When "civil advantages" are to be gained,
What god or what goddess may help to obtain you 'em,
  Hindoo or Chinese, so they're only obtained.

In this world (let me hint in your organ auricular)
  All the good things to good hypocrites fall;
And he who in swallowing creeds is particular,
  Soon will have nothing to swallow at all.

Oh place me where _Fo_ (or, as some call him, _Fot_)
  Is the god from whom "civil advantages" flow,
And you'll find, if there's anything snug to be got,
  I shall soon be on excellent terms with old _Fo_.

Or were I where _Vishnu_, that four-handed god,
  Is the quadruple giver of pensions and places,
I own I should feel it unchristian and odd
  Not to find myself also in _Vishnu's_ good graces.

For among all the gods that humanely attend
  To our wants in this planet, the gods to _my_ wishes
Are those that, like _Vishnu_ and others, descend
  In the form so attractive, of loaves and of fishes![1]

So take my advice--for if even the devil
  Should tempt men again as an idol to try him,
'Twere best for us Tories even then to be civil,
  As nobody doubts we should get something by him.


[1] Vishnu was (as Sir W. Jones calls him) "a pisciform god,"--his first
Avatar being in the shape of a fish.






ENIGMA.


    _monstrum nulla virtute_ redemptum.


Come, riddle-me-ree, come, riddle-me-ree,
  And tell me what my name may be.
I am nearly one hundred and thirty years old,
  And therefore no chicken, as you may suppose;--
Tho' a dwarf in my youth (as my nurses have told),
  I have, every year since, been out-growing my clothes:
Till at last such a corpulent giant I stand,
  That if folks were to furnish me now with a suit,
It would take every morsel of _scrip_ in the land
  But to measure my bulk from the head to the foot.
Hence they who maintain me, grown sick of my stature,
  To cover me nothing but _rags_ will supply;
And the doctors declare that in due course of nature
  About the year 30 in rags I shall die.
Meanwhile, I stalk hungry and bloated around,
  An object of _interest_ most painful to all;
In the warehouse, the cottage, the place I'm found,
  Holding citizen, peasant, and king in nay thrall.
    Then riddle-me-ree, oh riddle-me-ree,
    Come tell me what my name may be.

When the lord of the counting-house bends o'er his book,
  Bright pictures of profit delighting to draw,
O'er his shoulders with large cipher eyeballs I look,
  And down drops the pen from his paralyzed paw!
When the Premier lies dreaming of dear Waterloo,
  And expects thro' _another_ to caper and prank it,
You'd laugh did you see, when I bellow out "Boo!"
  How he hides his brave Waterloo head in the blanket.
When mighty Belshazzar brims high in the hall
  His cup, full of gout, to the Gaul's overthrow,
Lo, "_Eight Hundred Millions_" I write on the wall,
  And the cup falls to earth and--the gout to his toe!
But the joy of my heart is when largely I cram
  My maw with the fruits of the Squirearchy's acres,
And knowing who made me the thing that I am,
  Like the monster of Frankenstein, worry my makers.
    Then riddle-me-ree, come, riddle-me-ree,
    And tell, if thou know'st, who _I_ may be.






DOG-DAY REFLECTIONS.

BY A DANDY KEPT IN TOWN.


    _"vox clamantis in deserto."_


1827.


Said Malthus one day to a clown
  Lying stretched on the beach in the sun,--
"What's the number of souls in this town?"--
  "The number! Lord bless you, there's none.

"We have nothing but _dabs_ in this place,
  "Of them a great plenty there are;--
But the _soles_, please your reverence and grace,
  "Are all t'other side of the bar."

And so 'tis in London just now,
  Not a soul to be seen up or down;--
Of _dabs_? a great glut, I allow,
  But your _soles_, every one, out of town.

East or west nothing wondrous or new,
  No courtship or scandal worth knowing;
Mrs. B---, and a Mermaid[1] or two,
  Are the only loose fish that are going.

Ah, where is that dear house of Peers
  That some weeks ago kept us merry?
Where, Eldon, art thou with thy tears?
And thou with thy sense, Londonderry?

Wise Marquis, how much the Lord Mayor,
  In the dog-days, with _thee_ must be puzzled!--
It being his task to take care
  That such animals shan't go unmuzzled.

Thou too whose political toils
  Are so worthy a captain of horse--
Whose amendments[2] (like honest Sir Boyle's)
  Are "_amendments_, that make matters _worse_;"[3]

Great Chieftain, who takest such pains
  To prove--what is granted, _nem_. _con_.--
With how moderate a portion of brains
  Some heroes contrive to get on.

And thou too my Redesdale, ah! where
  Is the peer with a star at his button,
Whose _quarters_ could ever compare
  With Redesdale's five quarters of mutton?[4]

Why, why have ye taken your flight,
  Ye diverting and dignified crew?
How ill do three farces a night,
  At the Haymarket, pay us for you!

For what is Bombastes to thee,
  My Ellenbro', when thou look'st big
Or where's the burletta can be
  Like Lauderdale's wit and his wig?

I doubt if even Griffinhoof[5] could
  (Tho' Griffin's a comical lad)
Invent any joke half so good
  As that precious one, "This is too bad!"

Then come again, come again Spring!
  Oh haste thee, with Fun in thy train;
And--of all things the funniest--bring
  These exalted Grimaldis again!

THE "LIVING DOG" AND "THE DEAD LION."

1828.


Next week will be published (as "Lives" are the rage)
  The whole Reminiscences, wondrous and strange,
Of a small puppy-dog that lived once in the cage
  Of the late noble Lion at Exeter 'Change.

Tho' the dog is a dog of the kind they call "sad,"
  'Tis a puppy that much to good breeding pretends;
And few dogs have such opportunities had
  Of knowing how Lions behave--among friends;

How that animal eats, how he snores, how he drinks,
  Is all noted down by this Boswell so small;
And 'tis plain from each sentence, the puppy-dog thinks
  That the Lion was no such great things after all.

Tho' he roared pretty well--this the puppy allows--
  It was all, he says, borrowed--all second-hand roar;
And he vastly prefers his own little bow-wows
  To the loftiest war-note the Lion could pour.

'Tis indeed as good fun as a _Cynic_ could ask,
  To see how this cockney-bred setter of rabbits
Takes gravely the Lord of the Forest to task,
  And judges of lions by puppy-dog habits.

Nay, fed as he was (and this makes it a dark case)
  With sops every day from the Lion's own pan,
He lifts up his leg at the noble beast's carcass.
  And does all a dog so diminutive can.

However, the book's a good book, being rich in
  Examples and warnings to lions high-bred,
How they suffer small mongrelly curs in their kitchen,
  Who'll feed on them living and foul them when dead.

ODE TO DON MIGUEL.


    Et tu, _Brute_!


1828.[1]


What! Miguel, _not_ patriotic! oh, fy!
  After so much good teaching 'tis quite a _take-in_, Sir;
First schooled as you were under Metternich's eye,
  And then (as young misses say) "finisht" at Windsor![2]

I ne'er in my life knew a case that was harder;--
  Such feasts as you had when you made us a call!
Three courses each day from his Majesty's larder,--
  And now to turn absolute Don after all!!

Some authors, like Bayes, to the style and the matter
  Of each thing they _write_ suit the way that they _dine_,
Roast sirloin for Epic, broiled devils for Satire,
  And hotchpotch and _trifle_ for rhymes such as mine.

That Rulers should feed the same way, I've no doubt;--
  Great Despots on _bouilli_ served up _à la Russe_,[3]
Your small German Princes on frogs and sour crout,
  And your Viceroy of Hanover always on _goose_.

_Some_ Dons too have fancied (tho' this may be fable)
  A dish rather dear, if in cooking they blunder it;--
Not content with the common _hot_ meat _on_ a table,
  They're partial (eh, Mig?) to a dish of _cold under_ it![4]

No wonder a Don of such appetites found
  Even Windsor's collations plebeianly plain;
Where the dishes most _high_ that my Lady sends round
  Are here _Maintenon_ cutlets and soup _à la Reine_.

Alas! that a youth with such charming beginnings,
  Should sink all at once to so sad a conclusion,
And what is still worse, throw the losings and winnings
  Of worthies on 'Change into so much confusion!

The Bulls, in hysterics--the Bears just as bad--
  The few men who _have_, and the many who've _not_ tick,
All shockt to find out that that promising lad,
  Prince Metternich's pupil, is--_not_ patriotic!


[1] At the commencement of this year, the designs of Don Miguel and his
partisans against the constitution established by his brother had begun
more openly to declare themselves.

[2] Don Miguel had paid a visit to the English court at the close of the
year 1827.

[3] Dressed with a pint of the strongest spirits--a favorite dish of the
Great Frederick of Prussia, and which he persevered in eating even on his
death-bed, much to the horror of his physician Zimmerman.

[4] This quiet case of murder, with all its particulars--the hiding the
body under the dinner-table, etc.--is, no doubt, well known to the reader.






THOUGHTS ON THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND.

1828.


Oft have I seen, in gay, equestrian pride,
Some well-rouged youth round Astley's Circus ride
Two stately steeds--standing, with graceful straddle,
Like him of Rhodes, with foot on either saddle,
While to soft tunes--some jigs and some _andantes_--
He steers around his light-paced Rosinantes.

So rides along, with canter smooth and pleasant,
That horseman bold, Lord Anglesea, at present;--
_Papist_ and _Protestant_ the coursers twain,
That lend their necks to his impartial rein,
And round the ring--each honored, as they go,
With equal pressure from his gracious toe--

To the old medley tune, half "Patrick's Day"
And half "Boyne Water," take their cantering way,
While Peel, the showman in the middle, cracks
His long-lasht whip to cheer the doubtful hacks.
Ah, ticklish trial of equestrian art!
How blest, if neither steed would bolt or start;--
If _Protestant's_ old restive tricks were gone,
And _Papist's_ winkers could be still kept on!
But no, false hopes--not even the great Ducrow
'Twixt two such steeds could 'scape an overthrow:
If _solar_ hacks played Phaëton a trick,
What hope, alas, from hackneys _lunatic_?

If once my Lord his graceful balance loses,
Or fails to keep each foot where each horse chooses;
If Peel but gives one _extra_ touch of whip
To _Papist's_ tail or _Protestant's_ ear-tip--
That instant ends their glorious horsmanship!
Off bolt the severed steeds, for mischief free.
And down between them plumps Lord Anglesea!






THE LIMBO OF LOST REPUTATIONS.

A DREAM.


    "_Cio che si perde qui, là si raguna_."
    ARIOSTO.

    "---a valley, where he sees
    Things that on earth were lost."
    MILTON.


1828.


Knowest thou not him[1] the poet sings,
  Who flew to the moon's serene domain,
And saw that valley where all the things,
  That vanish on earth are found again--
The hopes of youth, the resolves of age,
The vow of the lover, the dream of the sage,
The golden visions of mining cits,
  The promises great men strew about them;
And, packt in compass small, the wits
  Of monarchs who rule as well without them!--
Like him, but diving with wing profound,
I have been to a Limbo underground,
Where characters lost on earth, (and _cried_,
In vain, like Harris's, far and wide,)
In heaps like yesterday's orts, are thrown
And there, so worthless and flyblown
That even the imps would not purloin them,
Lie till their worthy owners join them.

Curious it was to see this mass
  Of lost and torn-up reputations;--
Some of them female wares, alas!
  Mislaid at _innocent_ assignations;
Some, that had sighed their last amen
  From the canting lips of saints that would be;
And some once owned by "the best of men,"
  Who had proved-no better than they should be.
'Mong others, a poet's fame I spied,
  Once shining fair, now soakt and black--
"No wonder" (an imp at my elbow cried),
  "For I pickt it out of a butt of sack!"

Just then a yell was heard o'er head,
  Like a chimney-sweeper's lofty summons;
And lo! a devil right downward sped,
Bringing within his claws so red
Two statesmen's characters, found, he said,
  Last night, on the floor of the House of Commons;
The which, with black official grin,
He now to the Chief Imp handed in;--
_Both_ these articles much the worse
  For their journey down, as you may suppose;
But _one_ so devilish rank--"Odd's curse!".
  Said the Lord Chief Imp, and held his nose.
"Ho, ho!" quoth he, "I know full well
  "From whom these two stray matters fell;"--
Then, casting away, with loathful shrug,
The uncleaner waif (as he would a drug
The Invisible's own dark hand had mixt),
His gaze on the other[2] firm he fixt,
And trying, tho' mischief laught in his eye,
To be moral because of the _young_ imps by,
"What a pity!" he cried--"so fresh its gloss,
"So long preserved--'tis a public loss!
"This comes of a man, the careless blockhead,
"Keeping his character in his pocket;
"And there--without considering whether
"There's room for that and his gains together--
"Cramming and cramming and cramming away,
"Till--out slips character some fine day!

"However"--and here he viewed it round--
"This article still may pass for sound.
"Some flaws, soon patched, some stains are all
"The harm it has had in its luckless fall.
"Here, Puck!" and he called to one of his train--
"The owner may have this back again.
"Tho' damaged for ever, if used with skill,
"It may serve perhaps to _trade on_ still;
"Tho' the gem can never as once be set,
"It will do for a Tory Cabinet."

HOW TO WRITE BY PROXY.


    _qui facit per alium facit per se_.


'Mong our neighbors, the French, in the good olden time
  When Nobility flourisht, great Barons and Dukes
Often set up for authors in prose and in rhyme,
  But ne'er took the trouble to write their own books.

Poor devils were found to do this for their betters;--
  And one day a Bishop, addressing a _Blue_,
Said, "Ma'am, have you read my new Pastoral Letters?"
  To which the _Blue_ answered--"No, Bishop, have you?"

The same is now done by _our_ privileged class;
  And to show you how simple the process it needs,
If a great Major-General[1] wishes to pass
  For an author of History, thus he proceeds:--

First, scribbling his own stock of notions as well
  As he can, with a _goose_-quill that claims him as _kin_,
He settles his neckcloth--takes snuff--rings the bell,
  And yawningly orders a Subaltern in.

The Subaltern comes--sees his General seated,
  In all the self-glory of authorship swelling;--
"There look," saith his Lordship, "my work is completed,--
"It wants nothing now but the grammar and spelling."

Well used to a _breach_, the brave Subaltern dreads
  Awkward breaches of syntax a hundred times more;
And tho' often condemned to see breaking of heads,
  He had ne'er seen such breaking of Priscian's before.

However, the job's sure to _pay_--that's enough--
  So, to it he sets with his tinkering hammer,
Convinced that there never was job half so tough
As the mending a great Major-General's grammar.

But lo! a fresh puzzlement starts up to view--
  New toil for the Sub.--for the Lord new expense:
'Tis discovered that mending his _grammar_ won't do,
  As the Subaltern also must find him in _sense_!

At last--even this is achieved by his aid;
  Friend Subaltern pockets the cash and--the story;
Drums beat--the new Grand March of Intellect's played--
  And off struts my Lord, the Historian, in glory!


[1] Or Lieutenant-General, as it may happen to be.






IMITATION OF THE INFERNO OF DANTE.


    _"Cosi quel fiato gli spiriti mali
    Di quà, di là, di giu, di su gli mena."_


    _Inferno_, canto 5.


I turned my steps and lo! a shadowy throng
Of ghosts came fluttering towards me--blown along,
Like cockchafers in high autumnal storms,
By many a fitful gust that thro' their forms
Whistled, as on they came, with wheezy puff,
And puft as--tho' they'd never puff enough.

"Whence and what are ye?" pitying I inquired
Of these poor ghosts, who, tattered, tost, and tired
With such eternal puffing, scarce could stand
On their lean legs while answering my demand.
"We once were authors"--thus the Sprite, who led
This tag-rag regiment of spectres, said--
"Authors of every sex, male, female, neuter,
"Who, early smit with love of praise and--_pewter_,[1]
"On C--lb--n's shelves first saw the light of day,
"In ---'s puffs exhaled our lives away--
"Like summer windmills, doomed to dusty peace,
"When the brisk gales that lent them motion, cease.
"Ah! little knew we then what ills await
"Much-lauded scribblers in their after-state;
"Bepuft on earth--how loudly Str--t can tell--
"And, dire reward, now doubly puft in hell!"

  Touched with compassion for this ghastly crew,
Whose ribs even now the hollow wind sung thro'
In mournful prose,--such prose as Rosa's[2] ghost
Still, at the accustomed hour of eggs and toast,
Sighs thro' the columns of the _Morning Post_,--
Pensive I turned to weep, when he who stood
Foremost of all that flatulential brood,
Singling a _she_-ghost from the party, said,
"Allow me to present Miss X. Y. Z.,[3]
"One of our _lettered_ nymphs--excuse the pun--
"Who gained a name on earth by--having none;
"And whose initials would immortal be,
"Had she but learned those plain ones, A. B. C.

"Yon smirking ghost, like mummy dry and neat,
"Wrapt in his own dead rhymes--fit winding-sheet--
"Still marvels much that not a soul should care
"One single pin to know who wrote 'May Fair;'--
"While this young gentleman," (here forth he drew
A dandy spectre, puft quite thro' and thro',
As tho' his ribs were an AEolian lyre
For the whole Row's soft _trade_winds to inspire,)
"This modest genius breathed one wish alone,
"To have his volume read, himself unknown;
"But different far the course his glory took,
"All knew the author, and--none read the book.

"Behold, in yonder ancient figure of fun,
"Who rides the blast, Sir Jonah Barrington;--
"In tricks to raise the wind his life was spent,
"And now the wind returns the compliment.
"This lady here, the Earl of ---'s sister,
"Is a dead novelist; and this is Mister--
"Beg pardon--_Honorable_ Mister Lister,
"A gentleman who some weeks since came over
"In a smart puff (wind S. S. E.) to Dover.
"Yonder behind us limps young Vivian Grey,
"Whose life, poor youth, was long since blown away--
"Like a torn paper-kite on which the wind
"No further purchase for a puff can find."

"And thou, thyself"--here, anxious, I exclaimed--
"Tell us, good ghost, how thou, thyself, art named."
"Me, Sir!" he blushing cried--"Ah! there's the rub--
"Know, then--a waiter once at Brooks's Club,
"A waiter still I might have long remained,
"And long the club-room's jokes and glasses drained;
"But ah! in luckless hour, this last December,
"I wrote a book,[4] and Colburn dubbed me 'Member'--
"'Member of Brooks's!'--oh Promethean puff,
"To what wilt thou exalt even kitchen-stuff!
"With crumbs of gossip, caught from dining wits,
"And half-heard jokes, bequeathed, like half-chewed bits,
"To be, each night, the waiter's perquisites;--
"With such ingredients served up oft before,
"But with fresh fudge and fiction garnisht o'er,
"I managed for some weeks to dose the town,
"Till fresh reserves of nonsense ran me down;
"And ready still even waiters' souls to damn,
"The Devil but rang his bell, and--here I am;--
"Yes--'Coming _up_, Sir,' once my favorite cry,
"Exchanged for 'Coming _down_, Sir,' here am I!"

Scarce had the Spectre's lips these words let drop,
When, lo! a breeze--such as from ---'s shop
Blows in the vernal hour when puffs prevail,
And speeds the _sheets_ and swells the lagging _sale_--
Took the poor waiter rudely in the poop,
And whirling him and all his grisly group
Of literary ghosts--Miss X. Y. Z.--
The nameless author, better known than read--
Sir Jo--the Honorable Mr. Lister,
And last, not least, Lord Nobody's twin-sister--
Blew them, ye gods, with all their prose and rhymes
And sins about them, far into those climes
"Where Peter pitched his waistcoat"[5] in old times,
Leaving me much in doubt as on I prest,
With my great master, thro' this realm unblest,
Whether Old Nick or Colburn puffs the best.

LAMENT FOR THE LOSS OF LORD BATHURST'S TAIL.[1]


All _in_ again--unlookt for bliss!
Yet, ah! _one_ adjunct still we miss;--
One tender tie, attached so long
To the same head, thro' right and wrong.
Why, Bathurst, why didst thou cut off
  That memorable tail of thine?
Why--as if _one_ was not enough--
  Thy pig-tie with thy place resign,
And thus at once both _cut_ and _run_?
Alas! my Lord, 'twas not well done,
'Twas not, indeed,--tho' sad at heart,
From office and its sweets to part,
Yet hopes of coming in again,
Sweet Tory hopes! beguiled our pain;
But thus to miss that tail of thine,
Thro' long, long years our rallying sign--
As if the State and all its powers
By tenancy _in tail_ were ours--
To see it thus by scissors fall,
_This_ was "the unkindest _cut_ of all!"
It seemed as tho' the ascendant day
Of Toryism had past away,
And proving Samson's story true,
She lost her vigor with her _queue_.

Parties are much like fish, 'tis said--
The tail directs them, not the head;
Then how could _any_ party fail,
That steered its course by Bathurst's tail?
Not Murat's plume thro' Wagram's fight
  E'er shed such guiding glories from it,
As erst in all true Tories sight,
  Blazed from our old Colonial comet!
If you, my Lord, a Bashaw were,
(As Wellington will be anon)
Thou mightst have had a tail to spare;
  But no! alas! thou hadst but one,
  And _that_--like Troy, or Babylon,
  A tale of other times--is gone!
Yet--weep ye not, ye Tories true--
  Fate has not yet of all bereft us;
Though thus deprived of Bathurst's _queue_,
  We've Ellenborough's _curls_ still left us:--
Sweet curls, from which young Love, so vicious,
His shots, as from nine-pounders, issues;
Grand, glorious curls, which in debate
Surcharged with all a nation's fate,
His Lordship shakes, as Homer's God did,[2]
  And oft in thundering talk comes near him;
Except that there the _speaker_ nodded
  And here 'tis only those who hear him.
Long, long, ye ringlets, on the soil
  Of that fat cranium may ye flourish,
With plenty of Macassar oil
  Thro' many a year your growth to nourish!
And ah! should Time too soon unsheath
  His barbarous shears such locks to sever,
Still dear to Tories even in death,
Their last loved relics we'll bequeath,
  A _hair_-loom to our sons for ever.

THE CHERRIES.

A PARABLE.[1]

1838.


See those cherries, how they cover
  Yonder sunny garden wall;--
Had they not that network over,
  Thieving birds would eat them all.

So to guard our posts and pensions,
  Ancient sages wove a net,
Thro' whose holes of small dimensions
  Only _certain_ knaves can get.

Shall we then this network widen;
  Shall we stretch these sacred holes,
Thro' which even already slide in
  Lots of small dissenting souls?

"God forbid!" old Testy crieth;
  "God forbid!" so echo I;
Every ravenous bird that flieth
  Then would at our cherries fly.

Ope but half an inch or so,
  And, behold! what bevies break in;--
_Here_ some curst old Popish crow
  Pops his long and lickerish beak in;

_Here_ sly Arians flock unnumbered,
  And Socinians, slim and spare,
Who with small belief encumbered
  Slip in easy anywhere;--

Methodists, of birds the aptest,
  Where there's _pecking_ going on;
And that water-fowl, the Baptist--
  All would share our fruits anon;

Every bird of every city,
  That for years with ceaseless din,
Hath reverst the starling's ditty,
  Singing out "I can't get in."

"God forbid!" old _Testy_ snivels;
  "God forbid!" I echo too;
Rather may ten thousand devils
  Seize the whole voracious crew!

If less costly fruits won't suit 'em,
  Hips and haws and such like berries,
Curse the cormorants! stone 'em, shoot 'em,
  Anything--to save our cherries.

STANZAS WRITTEN IN ANTICIPATION OF DEFEAT.[1]

1828.


Go seek for some abler defenders of wrong,
  If we _must_ run the gantlet thro' blood and expense;
Or, Goths as ye are, in your multitude strong,
  Be content with success and pretend not to sense.

If the words of the wise and the generous are vain,
  If Truth by the bowstring _must_ yield up her breath,
Let Mutes do the office--and spare her the pain
  Of an Inglis or Tyndal to talk her to death.

Chain, persecute, plunder--do all that you will--
  But save us, at least, the old womanly lore
Of a Foster, who, dully prophetic of ill,
  Is at once the _two_ instruments, AUGUR[2] and BORE.

Bring legions of Squires--if they'll only be mute--
  And array their thick heads against reason and right,
Like the Roman of old, of historic repute,[3]
  Who with droves of dumb animals carried the fight;

Pour out from each corner and hole of the Court
  Your Bedchamber lordlings, your salaried slaves,
Who, ripe for all job-work, no matter what sort,
  Have their consciences tackt to their patents and staves.

Catch all the small fry who, as Juvenal sings,
  Are the Treasury's creatures, wherever they swim;
With all the base, time-serving _toadies_ of Kings,
  Who, if Punch were the monarch, would worship even him;

And while on the _one_ side each name of renown
  That illumines and blesses our age is combined;
While the Foxes, the Pitts, and the Cannings look down,
  And drop o'er the cause their rich mantles of Mind;

Let bold Paddy Holmes show his troops on the other,
  And, counting of noses the quantum desired,
Let Paddy but say, like the Gracchi's famed mother,
  "Come forward, my _jewels_"--'tis all that's required.

And thus let your farce be enacted hereafter--
  Thus honestly persecute, outlaw and chain;
But spare even your victims the torture of laughter,
  And never, oh never, try _reasoning_ again!

ODE TO THE WOODS AND FORESTS.

BY ONE OF THE BOARD.

1828.


Let other bards to groves repair,
  Where linnets strain their tuneful throats;
Mine be the Woods and Forests where
  The Treasury pours its sweeter _notes_.

No whispering winds have charms for me,
  Nor zephyr's balmy sighs I ask;
To raise the wind for Royalty
  Be all our Sylvan zephyr's task!

And 'stead of crystal brooks and floods,
  And all such vulgar irrigation,
Let Gallic rhino thro' our Woods
  Divert its "course of liquidation."

Ah, surely, Vergil knew full well
  What Woods and Forests _ought_ to be,
When sly, he introduced in hell
  His guinea-plant, his bullion-tree;[1]--

Nor see I why, some future day,
  When short of cash, we should not send
Our Herries down--he knows the way--
  To see if Woods in hell will _lend_.

Long may ye flourish, sylvan haunts,
  Beneath whose "_branches_ of expense"
Our gracious King gets all he wants,--
  _Except_ a little taste and sense.

Long, in your golden shade reclined.
  Like him of fair Armida's bowers,
May Wellington some _wood_-nymph find,
  To cheer his dozenth lustrum's hours;

To rest from toil the Great Untaught,
  And soothe the pangs his warlike brain
Must suffer, when, unused to thought,
  It tries to think and--tries in vain.

Oh long may Woods and Forests be
  Preserved in all their teeming graces,
To shelter Tory bards like me
  Who take delight in Sylvan _places_!

    "Take back the virgin page."
    MOORE'S _Irish Melodies_.


No longer dear Vesey, feel hurt and uneasy
  At hearing it said by the Treasury brother,
That thou art a sheet of blank paper, my Vesey,
  And he, the dear, innocent placeman, another.[2]

For lo! what a service we Irish have done thee;--
  Thou now art a sheet of blank paper no more;
By St. Patrick, we've scrawled such a lesson upon thee
  As never was scrawled upon foolscap before.

Come--on with your spectacles, noble Lord Duke,
  (Or O'Connell has _green_ ones he haply would lend you,)
Read Vesey all o'er (as you _can't_ read a book)
  And improve by the lesson we bog-trotters send you;

A lesson, in large _Roman_ characters traced,
  Whose awful impressions from you and your kin
Of blank-sheeted statesmen will ne'er be effaced--
  Unless, 'stead of _paper_, you're mere _asses' skin_.

Shall I help you to construe it? ay, by the Gods,
  Could I risk a translation, you _should_ have a rare one;
But pen against sabre is desperate odds,
  And you, my Lord Duke (as you _hinted_ once), wear one.

Again and again I say, read Vesey o'er;--
  You will find him worth all the old scrolls of papyrus
That Egypt e'er filled with nonsensical lore,
  Or the learned Champollion e'er wrote of, to tire us.

All blank as he was, we've returned him on hand,
  Scribbled o'er with a warning to Princes and Dukes,
Whose plain, simple drift if they _won't_ understand,
  Tho' carest at St. James's, they're fit for St. Luke's.

Talk of leaves of the Sibyls!--more meaning conveyed is
  In one single leaf such as now we have spelled on,
Than e'er hath been uttered by all the old ladies
  That ever yet spoke, from the Sibyls to Eldon.


[1] These verses were suggested by the result of the Clare election, in
the year 1828, when the Right Honorable W. Vesey Fitzgerald was rejected,
and Mr. O'Connell returned.

these gentlemen, had then produced a good deal of amusement.

  'Tis so pretty a bolus!--just down let it go,
  And, at vonce, such a _radical_ shange you vill see,
Dat I'd not be surprished, like de horse in de show,
  If your heads all vere found, vere your tailsh ought to be!
  Vill nobodies try my nice _Annual Pill_, etc.

'Twill cure all Electors and purge away clear
  Dat mighty bad itching dey've got in deir hands--
'Twill cure too all Statesmen of dulness, ma tear,
  Tho' the case vas as desperate as poor Mister VAN'S.
Dere is noting at all vat dis Pill vill not reach--
  Give the Sinecure Ghentleman van little grain,
Pless ma heart, it vill act, like de salt on de leech,
  And he'll throw de pounds, shillings, and pence, up again!
  Vill nobodies try my nice _Annual Pill_, etc.

'Twould be tedious, ma tear, all its peauties to paint--
  "But, among oder tings _fundamentally_ wrong,
It vill cure de Proad Pottom[1]--a common complaint
  Among M.P.'s and weavers--from _sitting_ too long.
Should symptoms of _speeching_ preak out on a dunce
  (Vat is often de case), it vill stop de disease,
And pring avay all de long speeches at vonce,

"IF" AND "PERHAPS."[1]


Oh tidings of freedom! oh accents of hope!
  Waft, waft them, ye zephyrs, to Erin's blue sea,
And refresh with their sounds every son of the Pope,
  From Dingle-a-cooch to far Donaghadee.

"_If_ mutely the slave will endure and obey,
  "Nor clanking his fetters nor breathing his pains,
"His masters _perhaps_ at some far distant day
  "May _think_ (tender tyrants!) of loosening his chains."

Wise "if" and "perhaps!"--precious salve for our wounds,
  If he who would rule thus o'er manacled mutes,
Could check the free spring-tide of Mind that resounds,
  Even now at his feet, like the sea at Canute's.

But, no, 'tis in vain--the grand impulse is given--
  Man knows his high Charter, and knowing will claim;
And if ruin _must_ follow where fetters are riven,
  Be theirs who have forged them the guilt and the shame.

"_If_ the slave will be silent!"--vain Soldier, beware--
  There _is_ a dead silence the wronged may assume,
When the feeling, sent back from the lips in despair,
  But clings round the heart with a deadlier gloom;--

When the blush that long burned on the suppliant's cheek,
  Gives place to the avenger's pale, resolute hue;
And the tongue that once threatened, disdaining to _speak_,
  Consigns to the arm the high office--to _do_.

_If_ men in that silence should think of the hour
  When proudly their fathers in panoply stood,
Presenting alike a bold front-work of power
  To the despot on land and the foe on the flood:--

That hour when a Voice had come forth from the west,
  To the slave bringing hopes, to the tyrant alarms;
And a lesson long lookt for was taught the opprest,
  That kings are as dust before freemen in arms!

_If_, awfuller still, the mute slave should recall
  That dream of his boyhood, when Freedom's sweet day
At length seemed to break thro' a long night of thrall,
  And Union and Hope went abroad in its ray;--

_If_ Fancy should tell him, that Dayspring of Good,
  Tho' swiftly its light died away from his chain,
Tho' darkly it set in a nation's best blood,
  Now wants but invoking to shine out again;

_If--if_, I say--breathings like these should come o'er
  The chords of remembrance, and thrill as they come,
Then,--_perhaps_--ay, _perhaps_--but I dare not say more;
  Thou hast willed that thy slaves should be mute--I am dumb.

WRITE ON, WRITE ON.

A BALLAD.


Air.--"_Sleep on, sleep on, my Kathleen dear.
          salvete, fratres Asini_. ST. FRANCIS.


Write on, write on, ye Barons dear,
  Ye Dukes, write hard and fast;
The good we've sought for many a year
  Your quills will bring at last.
One letter more, Newcastle, pen,
  To match Lord Kenyon's _two_,
And more than Ireland's host of men,
  One brace of Peers will do.
          Write on, write on, etc.

Sure never since the precious use
  Of pen and ink began,
Did letters writ by fools produce
  Such signal good to man.
While intellect, 'mong high and low,
  Is marching _on_, they say,
Give _me_ the Dukes and Lords who go
Like crabs, the _other_ way.
          Write on, write on, etc.

Even now I feel the coming light--
  Even now, could Folly lure
My Lord Mountcashel too to write,
  Emancipation's sure.
By geese (we read in history),
  Old Rome was saved from ill;
And now to _quills_ of geese we see
  Old Rome indebted still.
          Write on, write on, etc.

Write, write, ye Peers, nor stoop to style,
  Nor beat for sense about--
Things little worth a Noble's while
  You're better far without.
Oh ne'er, since asses spoke of yore,
  Such miracles were done;
For, write but four such letters more,
  And Freedom's cause is won!
